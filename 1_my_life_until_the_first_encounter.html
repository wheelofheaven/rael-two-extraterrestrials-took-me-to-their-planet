<h2 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>When I started this second book I wanted simply to relate what my life had been like before my fantastic encounter of 13 December 1973, to answer the many people who had asked firstly what I had done before that time, and secondly whether anything extraordinary had happened to me during my childhood that could have foreshadowed such a destiny.</p>
<p>I was surprised myself as I searched my memories, for even though I thought that nothing extraordinary had occurred at the beginning of my life, I found scenes resurfacing, which formed a whole when put together, and I saw that my life had really been guided for me to be what I was and to find myself where I did on December 13, 1973.</p>
<p>I had almost finished writing this account when the second encounter took place. Consequently, I have summed up my early memories briefly in order to give as much space as possible to the second part of this message and to provide a full account of this second contact, which turned out to be even more fantastic than the first.</p>
<h2 id="two-years-have-passed"><a class="header" href="#two-years-have-passed">Two Years Have Passed</a></h2>
<p>Two years! For almost two years now I have been trying somehow to radiate this truth, which is too great for me. Time goes by, and I feel I am getting nowhere. Yet, little by little, a solid core of people is forming around me, people who understand that <em>The Book Which</em> <em>Tells the Truth</em> really does just that.</p>
<p>There are seven hundred of them as I pen these lines, and I understand how this is both few and many at the same time. Few when we consider the four billion people who populate the Earth, and many when we consider how few people had decided, after two years, to follow the man who, two thousand years ago, had the equally heavy burden of being initiated and then initiating the primitive people of his time.</p>
<p>Who are these seven hundred? Are they, as the scoffers would no doubt love to believe, average simpletons who could be made to swallow anything? Not at all. Some of them are university graduates or people holding PhD's in philosophy, psychology, theology, sociology, medicine, physics, chemistry, etc.</p>
<p>My admiration perhaps goes as much to those who have no degree, since although they have not acquired knowledge through studying that would allow them to realize that living matter and people like us can be created scientifically, they are still able to feel it intuitively, as people capable of mastering matter and putting themselves in harmony with the universe that they are.</p>
<p>I must say that I am optimistic on the whole, and that I believe that I have so far accomplished the mission that has been entrusted to me.</p>
<p>For whatever happens to me, MADECH is up and running, and nothing will ever be able to stop it.</p>
<p>In two years I have given nearly forty lectures, and since certain questions come up regularly, I suppose some parts of the message need to be clarified. So I will try to do that in this work.</p>
<p>First of all, what path did I follow before the encounter of 13 December 1973? I have to admit I have only recently begun to look back on my life to figure out exactly how it had been guided for me to be available and ready to go into action on the spiritual, psychic and emotional levels at that time.</p>
<p>Certain events in my childhood had never seemed to me to have the least meaning when taken separately — but they did when taken together.</p>
<p>Now it all seems very clear to me, and I am moved when I remember some things that I considered unimportant at the time they
occurred. Far be it from me to tell my life story in a way that suggests that each event in it was exceptional, but it seems that many people want to know more about what had happened to me before.</p>
<p>Also, rather than leave it to wagging tongues, I would rather tell it all myself.</p>
<h2 id="childhood-a-ufo-over-ambert"><a class="header" href="#childhood-a-ufo-over-ambert">Childhood: a UFO over Ambert</a></h2>
<p>As the child of an unknown father, I cannot say that I had a typical childhood. I was what is called a &quot;natural&quot; child — as if all others were &quot;artificial&quot; children. My birth was an accident as it were, at least for the little town of Ambert, which is so devoutly Catholic that it is known as the &quot;world capital of the rosary&quot;. Furthermore, the unknown father, who was not totally unknown, was apparently a Jewish refugee. What sacrilege!</p>
<p>My birth was concealed as much as possible — not in a cave, but in a clinic at nearby Vichy. It occurred on 30 September 1946 at about two o'clock in the morning and was a very difficult one. But the important thing is that I was conceived on 25 December 1945.</p>
<p>Conception, the moment when a being truly begins to exist and develop in the womb of its mother, is the true date of birth for each individual. December 25 has been a very important date for almost two thousand years now. For those who believe in coincidences, my life began with a coincidence.</p>
<p>When we returned to Ambert, my poor mother tried for quite a long while to pass me off as &quot;the son of a friend she was taking care of for a while&quot; to her father who, even though he held it against her when he learned the truth, proved to be the nicest of grandfathers to me during the short time I knew him. Sadly, he died when I was still a very young child. I was later told about how amused he looked when, having seen him trim his fruit trees, I took a pair of scissors to cut... his lettuce.</p>
<p>I was raised by my grandmother and my aunt who were then, and still are, living together. They taught me to read and helped me take my first steps, which I remember very clearly — surely the earliest memory of my life.</p>
<p>It was only very recently that my grandmother told me that in 1947 she saw a strange craft flying very quickly and noiselessly over Ambert near her house. She had never dared tell anyone about it for fear of being accused of hallucinating. It was only after reading my book that she decided to talk to me about it... and at the same time she decided to join MADECH. Her decision to join was, in fact, one of the most important forms of encouragement that I received.</p>
<h2 id="the-pope-of-the-druids"><a class="header" href="#the-pope-of-the-druids">The Pope of the Druids</a></h2>
<p>In Ambert there was an old man of whom small children were afraid, and of whom the grown-ups made fun. They nicknamed him &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; because he had very long hair rolled up in a bun and a magnificent beard.</p>
<p>He was always clad in a long cape that came down to his ankles, and he lived about a hundred meters from the house where my mother had found a small apartment. He did not work, and nobody knew how he could afford to live in the minuscule house in front of the municipal grammar school.</p>
<p>As they got older, the children lost their fear of him, and like their parents, started to make fun of him, laughing and making faces as they followed at his heels.</p>
<p>Personally, I did not enjoy playing with the others, preferring to contemplate insects and look at books. I had passed this man in the street several times and had been surprised by his face, which radiated great kindness, and by the mischievous smile he wore whenever he looked at me. I did not know why, but he did not scare me, and I did not see anything laughable about him. Also I did not understand why the other children made fun of him.</p>
<p>One afternoon I followed him, curious about where he was going, and saw him go into his house, leaving open the door that led into a small, very dark kitchen. I went closer and could see him sitting on a stool with the mischievous smile on his face, as if he were expecting me. He motioned for me to come nearer. I went inside the house and moved towards him.</p>
<p>He laid his hand on my head, and I felt a strange sensation. At the same time, he looked up in the air and uttered some words that I did not understand. After a few minutes had passed, he let me go, still without saying a word, and still smiling the same mysterious smile.</p>
<p>All this had me puzzled at the time, but I very quickly forgot about it. It was only in the summer of 1974, when reading a book that my mother had lent me about the mysteries of Auvergne, that I learned that Father Dissard, the old man in question, was the last Dissard —that is, the last living &quot;Pope&quot; of the Druids— and that he had been dead for several years.</p>
<p>Then I recalled the scene from my childhood, and thought again of the mysterious smile that the old man used to give me each time I passed him in the street — which was every day, since we had been virtually neighbors. I now know exactly who he was addressing when he looked up in the air and uttered those mysterious phrases, just as I know exactly what the silent, luminous machine was that my grandmother had seen.</p>
<p>One other thing also comes to mind again. After the scene that took place at Father Dissard's house, I went to sleep every evening counting up to nine a certain number of times.</p>
<p>This is a number that has frequently come up in my life, like a code that has been assigned to me. I have never been able to explain this sudden habit, which began several years after I had learned to count much higher than nine, and therefore could not have been the result of learning by rote. I was seven years old when this incident took place.</p>
<h2 id="poetry"><a class="header" href="#poetry">Poetry</a></h2>
<p>At that time what mattered most to me were animals, which I loved to draw all day long, when I was not organizing snail races. I was fascinated by animal life, and I dreamt then only of becoming an explorer, so as to be able to get near the mysterious fauna of the virgin forests.</p>
<p>But at nine years of age —the number nine again— everything was to change. First of all, I was discovering what was to become a true passion for me — speed. Speed that is, on everything with wheels, with or without an engine. Speed and especially balance, the sense of trajectory and the struggle against oneself, against one's own reflexes — in fact, the ultimate mastery of mind over body.</p>
<p>It started with wild downhill runs on a little bicycle with almost no brakes, and I wonder how it was that I did not fall a single time. To liven things up, I would position myself at the top of a hill and wait for a fast car to pass by. Then I would launch into dizzying pursuit, catch up with the car and pass it —to the driver's great surprise— and, once at the bottom of the hill, I would turn and go back to wait at the top for another car.</p>
<p>A few months later, I found myself by chance attending the Tour de France motor race, and it was love at first sight. It was possible, I  then realized, to know the joys of high speed without having to pedal back up a hill. And you could make it your job.</p>
<p>I made up my mind, the way you can when you are nine years old. I would be a race-car driver. From that day on, my life was centered only around motor racing.</p>
<p>Nothing else interested me, and I did not see the point of learning all they taught me at school, since I was going to be a racing driver.</p>
<p>Children's comics were replaced by serious motor magazines, and I impatiently began counting off the years that separated me from the age when I could obtain a driver's license.</p>
<p>It was also at the age of nine that I had my first experience of boarding school. My mother was in despair because I no longer wanted to do anything at school, and I constantly told her that such learning was useless for motor racing drivers. So she decided to send me to the Notre-Dame-de-France boarding school in Puy-en-Velay.</p>
<p>She hoped that, without motor racing magazines, I would apply myself to school work, and in a way she was not far wrong. But I have very bad memories of that first boarding school, almost certainly because I was too young when I was sent there.</p>
<p>I remember that I spent many nights crying in a huge dormitory, where what I now believe I missed most was the chance to be alone and meditate.</p>
<p>This need, which caused me to spend entire nights crying, further increased my already great sensitivity, as will any emotional or affectionate need that is denied. Then I discovered poetry.</p>
<p>I had always been more attracted to literature than to mathematics, although only as an interested and passive reader. Then came the desire, the need to write — in verse if possible. I remained uninterested in mathematics, yet I had now achieved a solid average in that subject as in all others. But in French language, and especially writing, I regularly came first, as long as I liked the set subject. I even wrote an entire collection of poems and won first prize in a poetry competition.</p>
<p>The most surprising thing was that even though I had not been baptized, I was in a private boarding school run by Catholic monks, with all the praying which that involves —prayers before eating, and going to bed, before rising in the morning, before studying— and attending daily mass with communion. When, after six months of daily communion the brethren discovered that I had not been baptized, they seemed utterly horrified. I actually thought it was funny; it was in fact the only part of their mass that I liked, this free tasting of morsels of bread.</p>
<p>It was also at the age of nine that I attained puberty. I enjoyed it very much and discovering unknown and secret pleasures, which no other nine year-old in the dormitory seemed yet to know about, was some consolation for my incomplete solitude.</p>
<p>Finally, it was at the age of nine that I fell in love for the first time — and it was the intense kind of love that can seize children at that age.</p>
<p>Due to my improved classroom results, my mother had agreed not to send me back to boarding school, and I found myself in the fourth grade at the municipal grammar school in Ambert. There she was, nine years old or almost, and her name was Brigitte. I was shy and blushed quite ridiculously. It took only a glance during a medical visit, or perhaps a gesture of modesty to hide a non-existent bosom from my eyes, to release in me feelings of tenderness and a great desire to protect this apparently fragile being.</p>
<p>The following year I found myself at the same school, in the fifth grade, in the company of my first love to whom I dared not even speak. Still, I managed to end up sitting one desk in front of her at the beginning of the school year, so that I could turn my head from time to time and admire her beloved face. I was only ten and was always thinking about her.</p>
<p>The fact that I was close to her in class spurred me on, and I set myself to work hard enough to avoid having to repeat a year. In this way, I moved up to the sixth grade without the least interest in my studies.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we were now constantly changing classes and had different teachers instead of just one. As a result, I was almost always separated from her and did practically no work — so much so that the next year I found myself back in a boarding school in the small village of Cunlhat, which is about thirty kilometers from Ambert.</p>
<p>It was even worse there than it had been at Puy-en-Velay. We were all crammed into a tiny dormitory that was barely heated. and worst of all, there was virtually no discipline. So the biggest and strongest boys enforced their own law. I think that is where I developed such a hatred of violence.</p>
<p>One day, fed up with being bullied by boys against whom no disciplinary measures were ever taken, I took to the road on foot, determined to cover the thirty kilometers that separated me from my maternal home. Nobody noticed my departure, and when the school principal caught up with me in his car, I had already walked nearly ten kilometers.</p>
<p>To my great delight, I was kicked out of the school and sent back to the Catholic brethren at Ambert in the middle of the school year as a day boy. What joy! I could now see Brigitte every day in the street. By then she was twelve, her small bosom was budding deliciously, and to me she was more beautiful than ever.</p>
<p>I grew less and less interested in my studies and began to taste the joys of playing truant, mainly because I did not like finding myself back among the priests, who had quickly advised my mother to have me baptized. Fortunately, she preferred to wait until I was old enough to understand, so that she could ask my opinion.</p>
<p>What I would have liked at that time was to become a garage mechanic because I had learned that this was a useful skill for racing drivers. My mother, who hoped I would become an engineer, wanted me at all costs to continue with my studies, so she would not allow me to become apprenticed to a garage.</p>
<p>This new harassment gave me the desire to write poems again, and I started pacing about in the country with a notebook in my hand instead of attending classes.</p>
<p>At fourteen I found myself back in boarding school once more, this time in Mont-Dore, at a grammar school where they take children not wanted by any of the other schools in the region.</p>
<p>I found myself in the company of a fairly interesting collection of dunces and &quot;hard cases&quot;. It was one of the latter, a typical boarding school &quot;big shot&quot;, who ended up being responsible for the direction I took during the next ten years of my life. His name was Jacques, and he played the electric guitar, which quite impressed me. As soon as the Christmas holidays came, I got my grandmother to buy me a magnificent guitar, and Jacques taught me a few chords. Then I started setting my poems to music and noticed that it was apparently very pleasing to those who listened. As soon as the summer holidays came, I began to enter some radio singing contests, which I almost always won.</p>
<p>It was also during that summer vacation that I discovered physical love for the first time — with a barmaid who had been enchanted by my songs. She was twenty years old and did not teach me much apart from the effects that the guitar can have on women.</p>
<p>The following year I was fifteen and wanted more than ever to live my own life. One day I took my guitar under my arm along with a small suitcase, said farewell to the boarding school with its uninteresting studies, and hitchhiked to Paris. I had two thousand old francs in my pocket and a heart full of hope. At last I was going to earn my own living, save up enough money to take my driving test at the age of eighteen and become a racing driver.</p>
<p>By a stroke of luck a man driving a car that had tremendous acceleration hidden beneath discreet-looking bodywork picked me up. When he told me he was a racing driver and gave me his name, I was able to tell him which car he had driven and the awards he had won. He was flattered and surprised, little known as he was, to meet a young boy who remembered all his achievements. He told me that he had once been a clown, and that he now owned a garage in the southwest. When we arrived in Paris, he invited me out to dinner and even offered me a room in the hotel where he was staying.</p>
<p>In the lounge, we chatted a bit with two young women who were dance hostesses in a bar and had finished their day's work. I sang some songs, and then we went to bed each with one of our charming companions. There I was truly initiated into physical lovemaking.</p>
<p>The next morning, I left discreetly because I wanted to find a room and some cabarets that would be interested in my songs. I did not findeither and spent my second night in Paris in the subway with the tramps.</p>
<p>I had not a penny left, and the next morning, I was starving. I spent my day dawdling and despairing of ever sorting anything out.</p>
<p>But that evening I saw a man playing an accordion on a cafe terrace, and the customers were throwing him coins. I decided to try the same thing, and right from the start, it worked very well. I was saved.</p>
<p>I lived like that for three years, often sleeping anywhere and eating a sandwich from time to time. But I made enormous progress, and one day I was hired by a small cabaret on the Left Bank. I made ten francs each night and needed fifteen for the taxi ride back to Montmartre, where I lived in a small room. Yet I had my name on the poster — although in small print! Already I was imagining my name high up on the poster in big letters, seeing the success I was having every night.</p>
<p>One day I met the actor Jean-Pierre Darras who advised me to take acting classes to improve my stage presence. Since I did not have the means to pay for them, he kindly arranged for me to attend a course at the National Theatre of Paris free of charge. So for three months I took the Dullin course — and then gave it up because I did not feel at all attracted to the theatre.</p>
<p>I used to introduce myself at the time under the pseudonym of Claude Celler, which I had chosen as a tribute to the skier and champion racing driver, Tony Sailer. I modified the spelling so that my initials would become C C. — retaining my real first name.</p>
<p>I began to win a lot of radio contests, and by singing in several cabarets, I was able to live reasonably well, and more importantly, to save up enough money to take my driving test at exactly eighteen, as planned.</p>
<p>But that was not enough to become a racing driver. First I had to make a name for myself in the hope of being hired by a major company, and for that I needed to have a competition car, participate in some races independently and, if possible, win them. A racing car is very expensive, and I had to continue saving in the hope of acquiring such a vehicle. I continued with my singing and tried to put some money aside. Many writer-composer friends had made recordings and seemed to be making a lot of money from them. So I decided to try it, having by now more than 150 songs in my bag.</p>
<p>The first recording firm that I approached offered me a three-year contract, which I signed. The director of the recording firm was Lucien Morisse, the director of the radio station Europe No. 1, which had launched a tremendous number of famous singers. My first record was fairly successful, and the second, thanks to a song called <em>Le Miel et la Canelle</em> (Honey and Cinnamon), was even more popular.</p>
<p>It was often heard on the radio:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HONEY AND CINNAMON</p>
<p><em>I smell honey and cinnamon</em></p>
<p><em>I smell vanilla and love</em></p>
<p><em>I smell honey and cinnamon</em></p>
<p><em>Girls I'll always adore.</em></p>
<p><em>The first was a brunette, Margot was her name</em></p>
<p><em>We played the pipes as the moon lit the night</em></p>
<p><em>I took the road to her eyes</em></p>
<p><em>And followed the way to her hair.</em></p>
<p><em>The second was a blonde, her name was Marielle</em></p>
<p><em>The path around her curves I remember well</em></p>
<p><em>I took the road to her eyes</em></p>
<p><em>And followed the way to her hair.</em></p>
<p><em>The third was a redhead, Marion she was called</em></p>
<p><em>For her lovely little face and her frothy underslip</em></p>
<p><em>I took the road to her eyes</em></p>
<p><em>And followed the way to her hair.</em></p>
<p><em>Don't cry, my friend, for tomorrow will be spring</em></p>
<p><em>They are so lovely and you're not twenty yet</em></p>
<p><em>I took the road to her eyes</em></p>
<p><em>And you can travel the path to her hair.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was giving many performances and taking part in many road  shows. Everything was going well, and I even had the pleasure of being selected to participate in the Golden Rose song contest held in Antibes. But those who were guiding me did not really want me to become too famous an artist. That stage of my life had been planned to develop my sensitivity, and to accustom me to expressing myself in public, but no more than that.</p>
<p>Even though the fact that I was among the contestants selected for the Golden Rose was being announced on the radio every morning, Lucien Morisse came to me one day and explained that he had to withdraw me from the contest. He said that I would understand why later, but he could not tell me more at that moment.</p>
<p>So, in the end, I did not participate in that Golden Rose contest but had to continue to live on what I could earn from my singing, which I realized, would never be enough to buy a car that would get me into racing.</p>
<p>Therefore, when I was offered the opportunity to become a representative for the company where I did my recording, I accepted immediately, convinced that I would be able to save up enough for a car in a few months.</p>
<p>I found myself back in Bordeaux, where I was a commercial agent in charge of fifteen regions. I stayed there for a year and left when at last I had enough money to buy myself a competition car. I just had time to break that car in before a friend wrote it off in an accident.</p>
<p>However, I had composed new songs during the year in Bordeaux, and a wealthy friend urged me to make another record, which he would finance himself.</p>
<p>I spent another year living on my poetry and then, as if to make me change my lifestyle radically, I was involved in a very serious car accident.</p>
<p>On a very tiring tour I fell asleep at the wheel of my car and struck a wall head on, at about 100km per hour — 60 mph. More than ten people had already died at that spot. I came out of it with several fractures, but alive. I was immobilized for three months or more and my savings ran out. I was still not racing. I, who had dreamt of starting out at eighteen, had still not entered a single race by the age of twenty-two.</p>
<p>Having been to racing circuits many times as a spectator, I had noticed how infatuated young people were with this sport, and also the number of boys who wanted to be racing drivers without knowing how to proceed. I did not know much more than they did, and told myself that the best way for me to enter the racing scene would be to find a career that took advantage of their enthusiasm. I knew how to write, so the solution was obvious.</p>
<p>I would become a reporter for a sports car magazine.</p>
<p>I got in touch with a number of specialist magazines, but in vain because so many other young people had come up with the same idea. Then I noticed a small advertisement in the motor section of <em>L'Equipe</em> from someone looking for photographer-reporters, no experience required.</p>
<p>I wrote, and the advertiser replied saying that my application was being considered, but that I had to send 150 francs for administrative costs. In exchange, I would receive some film to make a test report on a subject of my choice. I sent the money, got back the film, wrote the report —on a motor race, of course— and immediately sent it to the address indicated.</p>
<p>Very soon afterwards, I received a letter asking me to call a number in Dijon, where the head office of the firm that had placed the advertisement was situated. I met the head of the publishing company — a man of about thirty years of age who claimed to have made a fortune in photography in the United States.</p>
<p>He seemed to be very interested in my ideas about the creation of a sports car magazine intended for young people who hoped to become racing drivers and offered to hire me as editor-in-chief of a newspaper that was to come out in a few months' time. He showed me the factory that he was going to buy to set up his printing office, introduced me to the printer in Dijon whom he had hired to be the director, and showed me the house where my wife and I could live, at a stone's throw from my office.</p>
<p>I replied that it would suit me, provided I could cover and participate in races. He then told me that he was also looking for someone capable of running a competitions department, since he intended to launch the new newspaper by racing some cars painted in his own colors. That would enable me to be right where the action was, and I agreed to be the director of the competitions department for this company.</p>
<p>A week later, I moved from Paris to Dijon with my wife, Marie-Paul. I had been married for about three months, and she was expecting our daughter. I had met Marie-Paule in the month of June, and we had not left each other's side since the first day we met. We had married three months later, only because her family was shocked to learn that we had no intention of getting married religiously. Her family was very old-fashioned, and at first I prayed with them before meals.</p>
<p>My stay in Dijon, however, lasted only two months, and I received no salary. It transpired that the &quot;rich American&quot; who had wanted to create a newspaper had in fact just come out of prison without a penny. He had swindled sums of money ranging from 150 francs to 300 francs from more than 500 young people dreaming, like me, of becoming racing drivers or photographer-reporters.</p>
<p>I had worked two months for nothing, and I found myself full of ideas, but penniless. This time I decided to make a start alone in the great world of publishing. I moved to Clermont-Ferrand, close to my mother who was then looking forward to becoming a grandparent very soon, and started my own publishing house to produce a magazine in my own way. This magazine was soon born, thanks to a printer who also loved sports cars and who agreed to take the risk of extending me credit, although I could not give him any form of guarantee.</p>
<p>The magazine took off quickly and soon became one of the leaders in its field. I reserved for myself the most interesting task — test driving new models on the magnificent circuit of Mas-du-Clos, at Creuse, and on the road. By this means I gained entry into the world of motor sport, and cars were lent to me to race. At last my dream was becoming a reality, and what is more, I found from the start that I was a gifted competition driver, gaining many victories with cars that were unfamiliar to me.</p>
<p>For three marvelous years I lived like this, all the time making continuous progress with my driving technique and concentrating 100 per cent on the field that I loved — that of sports cars. I must say that I felt a real pleasure in steadily pushing back my limitations and constantly improving control of my reflexes and reactions. However, I did not care for either engine noise or the smell of burning fuel, and I dreamed of days to come when racing car manufacturers would be required to make their cars odorless and noiseless. Only then could I enjoy fully the sensation of driving at its purest level.</p>
<p>But all this was turned upside down towards the end of 1973.</p>
<h2 id="the-encounter"><a class="header" href="#the-encounter">The Encounter</a></h2>
<p>On that extraordinary day, 13 December, 1973, I found myself in a crater of an Auvergne volcano, the Puy-de-Lassolas. There, as I have already described, I met for the first time an extra-terrestrial man, or more precisely, the Eloha —singular of Elohim— whom I would meet at the same place for six consecutive days and who, for about one hour each time, would dictate to me the fantastic revelations of <em>The Book Which Tells The Truth</em>.</p>
<p>For the first few days following this experience I must confess I wondered if I would dare tell anyone at all about it. The first thing I did was to make a neat copy of the notes that I had taken as best I could, although far too quickly as my interlocutor spoke to me.</p>
<p>When this was finished, I sent the original manuscript to a serious publisher who to my knowledge did not publish esoteric works or science fiction. Obviously I did not want this message of such importance to humanity to be lost among collections of mysterious adventure stories or occult books that cater for people interested in alternative sciences.</p>
<p>Marcel Jullian, who ran the publishing house, invited me to Paris and told me that the manuscript was sensational. But he said that I must tell my life story before talking about the message, and that there might be &quot;a few little changes to be made&quot;.</p>
<p>All that was absolutely out of the question. I did not want to take up a hundred pages telling my life story and then present the message that I had received, as if my personality were as important as those things which I had been asked to reveal. I wanted the message published, but only the message, even if it was not a thick book and thereby lacked interest for a publisher. So I asked Monsieur Jullian to return my manuscript. He replied that he did not have it because a reader had borrowed it, but that as soon as it was returned he would mail it to me. </p>
<p>I had just returned to Clermont-Ferrand when I received a telegram inviting me to return to Paris to appear in a television show named the <em>Great Chess Board</em>, presented by Jacques Chancel. He was the director of a series in the publishing house to which I had sent my manuscript. He had read it and understood that it was absolutely fantastic, whether anyone believed it or not. So I took part in the show, and the thousands of letters that I received afterwards showed that, while some laughed, many had taken what I said very seriously and wanted to help.</p>
<p>But days went by, and my manuscript was not returned. I sent a registered letter to the publisher, who replied that the manuscript would be sent to me, but that they had not yet found it. After ten days I went back to Paris to see if I could do something personally because nobody wanted to answer my questions any more when I telephoned to ask about the matter.</p>
<p>The famous designer, Courrèges, who had contacted me after the television show because he was interested, agreed to come with me to see the publisher in order to find out what exactly had become of the manuscript.</p>
<p>Marcel Jullian told us that the reader who had the manuscript had taken it with him on holiday, but they did not know where he was or how to reach him. The situation was becoming stranger and stranger.</p>
<p>In the end the manuscript was retrieved by Monsieur Courrèges, and he returned it to me personally. I still wonder if it had really been lost or just put away to prevent it from being published. If that publishing house really mislaid the manuscript so easily, then I would discourage other authors from sending their originals to them.</p>
<p>Alarmed by the mishap and by the growing pile of letters from people interested in buying the book containing the message as soon as it was published, Marie-Paule offered to leave her nursing job to help me with the publishing and distribution of this exceptional document.</p>
<p>I accepted because I was sure that this way, I would have permanent control over the use of these writings. Since it was incompatible with the seriousness of the mission that I had been given, I immediately stopped working for the sports magazine, and in the autumn of 1974, the book finally rolled off the printing press.</p>
<p>The shock to my nervous system caused by this unforeseen upset in my life had given me stomach pains and almost brought on an ulcer. All winter I suffered from a serious case of gastritis. No medication was effective, and it was only after I decided to take it easy by doing some meditation and breathing exercises that the pains vanished, as if by magic.</p>
<p>In June, I had been on a television show hosted by Philippe Bouvard. It was called <em>Saturday Evening,</em> and sarcastic as always, Monsieur Bouvard disguised his co-host as a Martian with pink antennae and a green suit, and asked me if he looked like the person I had met.</p>
<p>But many people, interested by the little I had been able to say, wrote to Philippe Bouvard, reproaching him for his lack of seriousness. Confronted by the thousands of letters he received, he decided to invite me back to do another show where I would be able to say a little more. Convinced that I would not be allowed to say enough, I decided to hire the Pleyel Hall for a date just after the television show and to announce to interested viewers that I would give a talk there in a few days' time. I hired a hall to seat 150, with an option on another to seat 500, as I did not know how many people would want to bother to come and listen to me.</p>
<p>In the end, more than 3,000 people came. Quite obviously we could only accommodate 500 in the hall I had booked, and when these seats were filled, we advised the others that I would give another talk in a few days in the great hall with 2,000 seats. Obviously, many people were not happy to leave, some of them having traveled several hundred kilometers.</p>
<p>In the end, everything went well, and I found that a great number of people were ready to help and support me, apart, of course, from those cynics whose questions, by virtue of their superficiality, I was able to show up as ridiculous.</p>
<p>Even though I had dreadful stage fright, much more than I had ever had when singing, everything went without a hitch, and the answers to the most difficult questions seemed to come to my lips by themselves. I really felt help coming from above, just as the Elohim had promised me. I had the impression of listening to myself give answers that I could not possibly have come up with alone.</p>
<p>The second talk took place a few days later. I was afraid that those who had not been able to get into the hall the first time would not come back, and that I would therefore find myself stuck with a very expensive hall nearly three quarters empty especially since there had not been any publicity about it since the television program, except for a short, three-line paragraph in <em>France Soir</em>, the only newspaper that would agree to publicize this second talk.</p>
<p>In the end, well over two thousand people came, and the hall was full. It was a triumph. From this time onward, I did not have any further doubts about the success of my mission.</p>
<h2 id="the-public-talks"><a class="header" href="#the-public-talks">The Public Talks</a></h2>
<p>From the month of September 1974 onwards, over the course of some forty lectures, I was able to see which questions came up most frequently. I also saw the membership of MADECH rising constantly, as regional offices formed in all the big towns of France around the most dynamic and active members.</p>
<p>I also saw some reporters pursuing their craft honestly and well, their job being to inform the public by writing or saying exactly what they had seen or read about. However, some like those from the newspaper, <em>Le Point</em>, wrote lies. Even after registered letters were sent to remind them that they had to rectify an inaccurate article in conformity with the right to respond, they did not do so properly.</p>
<p>Others, like those at the newspaper, <em>La Montagne</em>, simply refused to inform their readers that I was giving a talk in Clermont-Ferrand and exploited the fact that they were the only daily newspaper in that region. Their news director had in fact met me and said that never would my activities or I be mentioned in his newspaper. All this was because they did not like the fact that when I appeared initially on television, I had not first informed them before talking to a major French broadcasting organization — a sad story and a fine example of freedom of speech. They even refused to run a paid advertisement announcing that talk, although in the same newspaper there were full-page advertisements for pornographic movies.</p>
<p>As for the newspaper, <em>Le Point</em>, it simply transformed an excursion of MADECH members to the place where the encounter had occurred into a broken appointment with the Elohim.</p>
<p>These tricks were played in an attempt to ridicule an organization trying to get off the ground. It is evidently easier and less dangerous for a newspaper with an extensive readership to do this to a new organization like MADECH than to the Church, with its 2,000 years of usurpation.</p>
<p>But the day will come when those who have tried to hide or twist the truth will regret their mistakes.</p>
