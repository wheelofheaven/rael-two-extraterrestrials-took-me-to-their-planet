<h1 id="the-keys"><a class="header" href="#the-keys">THE KEYS</a></h1>
<h2 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>For thousands of years those opposed to enlightenment and reform have effectively imprisoned our minds in straitjackets. These writings, however, are the keys we can use to set ourselves free.</p>
<p>The door that seals the human mind is fastened by many locks, all of which must be opened at the same time if one wants to be able to free it towards the infinite. If only one key is used, the other locks will remain fastened, and if they are not all kept open at the same time, then while the second lock is being freed, the first one will close again, preventing the door from opening.</p>
<p>Human society is afraid of what it does not know, and so it is afraid of what lies behind this door — even if it is happiness gained through knowledge of the truth. Therefore, it applies pressure to prevent people from even partly opening this door because society itself prefers to remain in a state of misfortune and ignorance.</p>
<p>This is yet another obstacle found on the threshold of the doorway through which the mind must pass to free itself. But, as Gandhi said:</p>
<p>'It is not because no one sees the truth that it becomes an error.' So if you attempt to open this door, ignore the sarcasm of those who have not seen anything — and of those who having seen, pretend not to see, because of their fear of the unknown.</p>
<p>Also if opening the door seems too difficult for you, ask for help from a Guide, since Guides have already opened the doors of their own minds and know the difficulties involved. They will not be able to open your door for you, but they will be able to explain the different techniques that will enable you to succeed. Besides, they are living witnesses of the happiness that can be achieved by opening the door, and they prove wrong those who are afraid of what lies behind the door.</p>
<h2 id="humanity"><a class="header" href="#humanity">Humanity</a></h2>
<p>In every situation, we must always consider things in regard to four levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In relation to infinity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In relation to the Elohim, our parents and creators;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In relation to human society;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And finally, in relation to the individual.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The most important level is that relating to infinity, for it is in relation to this level that all things must be judged — but always with one constant factor: love. This means taking others into account, who must be given love, because we must live in harmony with infinity, and to do this we must live in harmony with others, because they are a part of infinity as well.</p>
<p>Then we must take into account the advice given by our creators, the Elohim, and act in such a way that human society listens to the advice of those who created it.</p>
<p>Then we must take into account society, which makes it possible for individuals to blossom on the path of truth. But although society must be taken into account, it should not be followed; on the contrary, society must be helped to emerge from its primitive straitjacket by regular questioning of all its habits and traditions, even if these are supported by laws that are only there to try and imprison our minds in shackles of obscurantism.</p>
<p>Finally, we must take into account the fulfillment of the individual.</p>
<p>Without this the mind does not reach its full potential, and it is impossible to harmonize yourself with infinity and become a new man if you are not fulfilled.</p>
<h3 id="birth"><a class="header" href="#birth">Birth</a></h3>
<p>You must never impose any religion whatsoever on a child, who is still but a larva, unable to understand what is happening to itself. So you must neither baptize nor circumcise children, nor submit them to any action that they have not themselves accepted. You must wait for them to reach the age when they can understand and choose, and if a religion appeals to them at that time, then leave them free to adhere to it.</p>
<p>A birth should be a festive occasion, for the Elohim created us in their image to be capable of reproducing ourselves. By creating a living being, we preserve our own species and respect the work of our creators.</p>
<p>A birth should also be an act of love, achieved in harmony as far as sounds, colors and temperature are concerned, so that the human being who is emerging into life develops the habit of being in harmony.</p>
<p>You must immediately develop in children the habit of respecting the liberty of others, and when they cry at night, go to them discreetly but without their realizing that crying has brought them the comfort of being tended. On the contrary, you must go to them and look after them when they make no sound, and not go to them —at least not with their being aware of it— when they cry. That way they will get used to everything going better when they are in harmony with their surrounding. &quot;God helps those who help themselves&quot;.</p>
<p>In fact, parents must understand that as soon as a child is born, it is first of all an individual, and that no individual should be treated like a child.</p>
<p>Even our creators do not treat us like children, but as individuals.</p>
<p>That is why they do not intervene directly to help us solve our problems but allow us to overcome the obstacles that we encounter by working things out for ourselves as responsible individuals.</p>
<h2 id="education"><a class="header" href="#education">Education</a></h2>
<p>The little creature who is still just the larva of a human being must, in its infancy, grow accustomed to respecting the liberty and the tranquillity of others. Since little children are too young to understand and reason, corporal punishment28 should be rigorously applied by the person bringing them up, so that they suffer when they cause suffering or disturb others by showing a lack of respect.</p>
<p>This corporal punishment28 should be applied only to very young children, and then, in keeping with the child's growing power to reason and understand, it should be phased out progressively and eventually stopped altogether. From the age of seven, corporal punishment28 should be quite exceptional, and from the age of fourteen, it should never be applied.</p>
<p>You will use corporal punishment28 only when punishing a child for not respecting the freedom and tranquillity of others or yourself.</p>
<p>You will teach your child to blossom, and you will teach him or her always to have a questioning attitude towards those things which society and its schools want to inculcate. You will not force your child to learn things that are not useful, and you will let him or her follow any desired path because, do not forget, the most important thing is his or her fulfillment.</p>
<p>You will teach your child always to judge things in the right order with respect to infinity, with respect to our creators, with respect to society, and with respect to itself.</p>
<p>You will not impose any religion on your child, but instead impartially teach him or her the various beliefs that exist throughout the world — or at least the most important ones in chronological order: the Jewish religion, the Christian religion and the Muslim religion. You will try to learn the major trends of thought of the eastern religions, if you can, so that you are able to explain them to your child. Finally, you will explain to him or her the main points of the message given by the Elohim to the last of the prophets.</p>
<p>Above all, you will teach your child to love the world in which it lives, and through this world, our creators.</p>
<p>You will teach him or her to open up to infinity and try to live in harmony with infinity.</p>
<p>You will teach your child about the marvelous work accomplished by the Elohim, our creators, and constantly seek ways for humanity to become capable of repeating, some day, what our creators have done — namely creating other humanities elsewhere by scientific means.</p>
<p>You will teach your child to consider itself a part of the infinite — that is, both immense and minute at the same time. &quot;From dust were ye made, and dust ye shall become.&quot;</p>
<p>You will teach your child that the wrong done to others cannot be repaired by any confession or absolution once it is done, and that it must not be thought that when death is near, it is sufficient to begin to believe in the Elohim or any god in order to have the right to eternal life.</p>
<p>You will teach your child that we are judged by what we do throughout our lives, that the path which leads to wisdom is long, and that it certainly takes a whole lifetime to master it sufficiently. A person who has not gone in the right direction throughout life will not gain the right to scientific resurrection on the planet of the eternals just by making a sudden late change to the right path — that is, unless that person's regret is truly genuine, and he or she acts with great sincerity, making up for lost time, striving to be forgiven by
those who were harmed, and devoting all his or her means to bringing them love and happiness.</p>
<p>All this will still not be enough for the person who has made others suffer, for even if he or she is forgiven by them and gives them love, the errors will have been erased, but nothing positive will have been accomplished.</p>
<p>This person will then have to set out anew, bring happiness to new people whom he or she has never harmed and help those who spread the truth, the guides.</p>
<p>But it is too late for someone who has regrets only at the moment of death or shortly before. This person will not be forgiven.</p>
<h2 id="sensual-education"><a class="header" href="#sensual-education">Sensual Education</a></h2>
<p>Sensual education is one of the most important things, and yet at the moment, it scarcely exists at all.</p>
<p>You will awaken the mind of your child, but you will also awaken his or her body, for the awakening of the body is linked to the awakening of the mind. All those who seek to numb the body are also numbing the mind.</p>
<p>Our creators have given us our senses so that we use them. The nose is meant for smelling, the eyes for seeing, the ears for hearing, the mouth for tasting, and the fingers for touching. We must develop our senses so as to get more enjoyment from all the things around us, which our creators put here for us to enjoy.</p>
<p>A sensual individual is far more likely to be in harmony with infinity, because such a person can feel it without having to meditate or reflect.</p>
<p>Meditation and reflection will enable that individual to understand this harmony better and to radiate it all around himself or herself by
teaching it. To be sensual means to let your environment give you pleasure.</p>
<p>Sexual education is very important as well, but it only teaches the technical functions and uses of the organs. Sensual education, on the other hand, teaches us how to gain pleasure from our organs purely for pleasure's sake, without necessarily seeking to use them for their utilitarian purposes.</p>
<p>To say nothing to your children about their sexual organs is wrong, and although it is better to explain what they are for, this is still not enough.</p>
<p>You must explain how they can gain pleasure from them.</p>
<p>To explain only their function would be like telling them that music is for marching to, that knowing how to write is helpful only for penning letters of complaint, or that movies are useful only for giving audio visual courses, and other such nonsense. Fortunately, thanks to artists and through the awakening of our senses, we can obtain pleasure from listening, reading or looking at works of art that were made for no other reason than to give pleasure. The same goes for the sexual organs. They are not just for satisfying our natural needs or for ensuring reproduction, but also for giving pleasure to others and ourselves. Thanks to science, we have finally emerged from the days when showing one's body was a &quot;sin&quot;, and when sexual intercourse brought its own punishment — the conception of a child.</p>
<p>Now thanks to contraceptive techniques, sexual union is freely possible without it becoming a definitive commitment — or even a possible one. You will teach your child all this without shame, but on the contrary, with love, clearly explaining that he or she was made to be happy and blossom fully — that is to say, to enjoy life with all the senses and with their full force.</p>
<p>You must never be ashamed of your body or of your nakedness, for nothing displeases our creators more than to see those they created feeling ashamed of the appearance that has been given to them.</p>
<p>You will teach your children to love their bodies and every part of the Elohim's creation, because in loving their creation, we love them as well.</p>
<p>Each one of our organs was created by our parents, the Elohim, so that we might use it feeling not shame, but happiness at using something for which it was designed. If the act of using one of our organs brings pleasure, it means that our creators wish us to have that pleasure.</p>
<p>Every individual is a garden that should not be left uncultivated. A life without pleasure is an uncultivated garden. Pleasure is the fertilizer that opens up the mind. Asceticism is useless unless it is a temporary ordeal designed to train the mind to dominate the body.</p>
<p>But once we have succeeded in the ordeal that we have set ourselves —which must always be limited in time— we should once more enjoy the pleasures of life.</p>
<p>Asceticism can be accepted as the fallow period of that garden which is an individual — that is to say, a momentary pause in the search for pleasure, which enables us to appreciate it better later on.</p>
<p>You will accustom your children to having more and more freedom by always treating them as individuals. You will respect their tastes and inclinations, as you would like them to respect your own. Make sure you realize that your child, male or female, is what it is, and that you will not be able to make it what you want, just as it will not be able to make you what it wants you to be. Respect your child so that it respects you, and respect its tastes so that it respects yours.</p>
<h2 id="fulfillment"><a class="header" href="#fulfillment">Fulfillment</a></h2>
<p>Self-fulfillment should be sought according to one's tastes and aspirations, without any preoccupation with what others think, as long as no one else is being hurt.</p>
<p>If you feel like doing something, first see that it does no harm to anyone, then do it without worrying about what others think of it. If you feel like having a sensual or sexual experience with one or several other individuals, whatever sex they may be, you may behave as you desire, as long as they agree. Everything is permitted on the path to
fulfillment in order to awaken the body, and hence the mind.</p>
<p>We are at last emerging from those primitive times when women were seen merely as instruments of reproduction belonging to society.</p>
<p>Thanks to science, women are now free to fulfill themselves sensually, without having to fear the punishment of pregnancy. At last, woman is truly the equal of man, since she may enjoy her body without living in fear of having to endure alone the undesired consequences of her acts.</p>
<p>Conceiving a child is something too important to be left to chance.</p>
<p>Therefore, do so only by choice after mature consideration in a marvelous act of love, being fully aware of what you are doing, and being certain that you truly wish it, because a child cannot become a successful individual unless it is truly desired at the very moment of
conception.</p>
<p>The moment of conception is the most important because it is at that time that the first cell, and therefore the plan of the individual, is conceived.</p>
<p>This moment must therefore be desired, so that the first cell may be created in perfect harmony, with the minds of the two parents thinking strongly and consciously of the human being that they are conceiving. This is one of the secrets of the new individual.</p>
<p>If you are looking only for the fulfillment of your body, and therefore of your mind, use the means that science has put at your disposal, starting with contraception. Only conceive a child when you yourself are fulfilled, so that the life you conceive may be the fruit of the union of two fulfilled individuals.</p>
<p>To reach fulfillment, use the means that science has provided to enable you to awaken your body to pleasure without any risks.</p>
<p>Pleasure and procreation are two different things that must not be confused. The first is for the individual, and the second is for the species. It is only when the individual is fulfilled that he or she can create a fulfilled human being.</p>
<p>If by accident you have conceived a child without desiring it, use the means that science puts at your disposal — abortion. A child who was not desired at the moment of conception cannot blossom fully, since it was not created in harmony. Do not listen to those who try to frighten you by talking about the physical —and especially moral— consequences that an abortion can trigger. There are none if you are treated by competent people. It's rather by keeping an undesired child, that you will be left with physical and moral disturbances that can be passed on, and that will make the child you brought into the world suffer too.</p>
<p>Having a child does not necessarily imply that you must be married or even live with a man. Already, many women have decided to
have one or more children without marrying or living with a man.</p>
<p>The education of a child, who is an individual right from birth, should not necessarily be provided by the parents. It would indeed often be preferable for education to be entrusted to specialized people who would contribute far more than some parents towards their children's
fulfillment.</p>
<p>If you wish to have a child without living with a man, do as you desire. Fulfill yourself, as you would like, without worrying what others think.</p>
<p>If you choose to do this, do not think that you are condemned to live alone forever. Welcome the men you like, and they will serve as masculine role models for your child.</p>
<p>You can even decide one day to live with a man — this will not cause any problems for your child at all. On the contrary, it will contribute to his or her fulfillment. A change of environment is always positive for a child.</p>
<p>Society should organize itself to take charge of the education of children partially or totally, depending on the parents' wishes. Those parents who want to work should be able to leave their children in the custody of competent people, and those who want their children to receive an education given entirely by such individuals should be able to entrust their children completely to establishments created for this purpose. In this way, if you give birth to a child you desired, but afterwards you separate from your companion, or for any other reason you no longer desire the child, you will be able to entrust your child to society, so that it may be brought up surrounded by the harmony necessary for its fulfillment, for a child who grows up in surroundings where it is not really and truly wanted cannot blossom and be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Bringing up a child should be mutually fulfilling for both parent and offspring. If a child becomes a nuisance, however slight, it realizes this and fulfillment is affected. A child should therefore be kept near you only if its presence is felt to be fulfilling.</p>
<p>Otherwise the child should be put in establishments that society must create to encourage fulfillment and be placed there without the least regret.</p>
<p>On the contrary, parents should feel a profound sense of joy because they are entrusting their child to others more capable than themselves of helping each little individual to blossom.</p>
<p>Regular visits can even take place if the children, whose wishes are of primary importance, would like them. The people in charge of the children's education should always describe the parents as exceptional people, who placed more importance on their children's fulfillment than on their own selfish pleasure of bringing them up themselves.</p>
<p>They did this, the children should be told, by entrusting them to people more competent than themselves.</p>
<p>Choose your partner freely if you desire one. Marriage, whether religious or civil, is useless. You cannot sign a contract to unite living individuals, who are bound to change because they are alive.</p>
<p>Reject marriage, which is only the public proclamation of ownership of a person. A man or woman cannot be the property of anyone else. Any contract can only destroy the harmony existing between two individuals.</p>
<p>When we feel loved, we feel free to love, but when we have signed a contract, we feel like prisoners who are forced to love each other, and sooner or later we begin to hate each other. So you will live with the person of your choice only for as long as you feel happy with him or her.</p>
<p>When you no longer get on well together, do not remain together, because your union will become hell. All living beings evolve, and  rightly so. If the personal evolution of each individual is similar, the union lasts, but if their progress is different, then union is no longer possible. You no longer like the individual you used to like because one of you has changed. You must part from each other while</p>
<p>retaining happy memories of your time together, instead of spoiling it with useless bickering which gives way to hostility. A child chooses clothes that fit, and when it outgrows them, they must be changed for different clothes, otherwise they will be torn to pieces. The same applies for unions; you must leave each other before being torn to pieces.</p>
<p>Above all, do not be worried about your child. It is better for him or her to be with only one parent in harmony than to be with both in discord, or lacking perfect harmony. Do not forget that children are, above all, individuals.</p>
<p>Society must make absolutely sure that old people have a happy life without any material worries. But although we must respect the elderly and do everything to make them happy, we should not listen to them just because of their seniority.</p>
<p>An intelligent person can give good advice at any age, but a stupid person, even if he is a hundred years old, does not deserve to be listened to for a second. What is more, such a person has no excuse, having had an entire lifetime in which to try to awaken, whereas there is still hope for a young and stupid person. But in any case, a stupid old person must still be able to live comfortably. This is a duty for
society.</p>
<p>Death should not be an occasion for sad gatherings; on the contrary, it should be a time of joyful celebration, because it is the moment when the beloved one may perhaps reach the paradise of the eternals in the company of our creators, the Elohim.</p>
<p>You will therefore ask not to be buried religiously, but you will donate your body to science, or you will ask that your body be disposed of as discreetly as possible, except for the bone of your forehead — more precisely the part located above the beginning of the nose, 33 millimeters (1.3 inches) above the middle of the axis linking the pupils of your eyes. At least one square centimeter (0.4 square inches) of this bone should be sent to the Guide of Guides, so that he may keep it in our embassy on Earth.</p>
<p>Each person is monitored by a computer that records all their actions and will make a tally of them at the end of their life. But people who know about this message which Claude Rael is communicating will be re-created from the cells that they have left in our embassy. In their cases, re-creation will take place only if they ensure that the required part of their body is sent to the Guide of Guides after their death.</p>
<p>The mechanism within the computer that records the information to be used in judgement of individuals remains in operation after they learn about the message. But the mechanism that allows an automatic sampling of a cell at the moment of death is disconnected.</p>
<p>So only those who comply exactly with what is required once they know about the message will be recreated.</p>
<p>Make sure that at least once in your life you see the Guide of Guides or a guide authorized by him to transmit your cellular plan to the Elohim, so that they may awaken your mind and help you to remain awakened.</p>
<p>In accordance with what is written earlier in this message, you will not leave an inheritance to your children, except for the family house or apartment. The rest you will leave in your will to the Guide of Guides, and if you fear your descendants might not respect your last will and testament but might try to recover your property through the courts, you will bestow it while you are alive on the Guide of Guides, in order to help him spread the message of our creators on Earth.</p>
<p>Those of you who remain after the death of a loved one, do not be sad and lament. Try instead to give love to those you love while they are still living, because once they are dead, what makes you unhappy is the thought that perhaps you did not love them enough, and that now it is too late.</p>
<p>Anyone who was good in their lifetime has the right to the Elohim's gardens for eternity and will know happiness, and anyone who was not good does not deserve to be missed.</p>
<p>But even if an individual is not among those chosen for re-creation, he or she does not really vanish. Death is not a very important thing, and we should not be afraid of it. It is just like falling asleep, except it is an endless sleep. Since we are a part of infinity, the matter of which we are made does not disappear. It continues to exist in the soil, or in plants, or even in animals, clearly losing all homogeneity and, therefore, all identity. This part of infinity that was organized by our creators according to a very precise plan returns to the infinite, while remaining a part of this small ball called Earth, which is alive.</p>
<p>Everyone has the right to live, the right to love and the right to die.</p>
<p>Everyone is the director of his or her own life and death. Death is nothing, but suffering is terrible, and everything must be done to eliminate it. Someone who is suffering too much has the right to commit suicide. If this person's actions were positive during his or her life, he or she will be admitted to the planet of the eternals.</p>
<p>If someone you love suffers very much and wishes to die, but does not have the strength to commit suicide, help them to take their own life.</p>
<p>When science one day enables you to eliminate human suffering, then you can ask yourselves whether it is right to commit suicide or not.</p>
<h2 id="society-and-government"><a class="header" href="#society-and-government">Society and Government</a></h2>
<p>Just as a human body has a brain to make decisions, it is essential that society also have a government to make decisions. So you will do everything you can to set up a government that practices geniocracy, which puts intelligence in power.</p>
<p>You will also participate in the creation of a worldwide political party advocating humanitarianism and geniocracy, as they are described in the first part of this message of the Elohim, and you will support its candidates. Only via geniocracy can humanity move fully into
the golden age.</p>
<p>Total democracy is not good. A body in which all the cells command cannot survive. Only intelligent people should be permitted to make decisions involving humanity. You will therefore refuse to vote, unless a candidate advocating geniocracy and humanitarianism is standing for election.</p>
<p>Neither universal suffrage nor public opinion polls are valid ways of governing the world. To govern is to foresee, not to follow the reactions of a sheep-like population, among whom only a very small number are sufficiently awakened to guide humanity. Since there are very few awakened people, if we base decisions on universal suffrage or opinion polls, the decisions become the choice of the majority — and therefore of those who are not awakened. Such people respond in the interests of their immediate gratification, or as a result of instinctive reactions that are unconsciously confined in a straitjacket of obscurantist conditioning.</p>
<p>Only geniocracy, which is a selective democracy, is worthwhile. As was stated in the first part of this message of the Elohim, only people whose net level of intelligence is fifty per cent above average should be eligible to stand for election, and only those whose net level of intelligence is ten per cent above the average should be eligible to vote. Scientists are already developing techniques to measure net intelligence. Follow their advice, and act in such a way that the most precious minerals of humanity —exceptionally gifted children— may receive an education at a level appropriate to their genius, since normal education is designed only for normal children of average
intelligence.</p>
<p>It is not the number of diplomas that one has obtained that signifies intelligence, since this only calls upon the rather uninteresting faculty of memory, which machines can replace.</p>
<p>Intelligence in its raw state is the quality that can make peasants or workers much more intelligent than engineers or professors. This can be spoken of as common sense, as well as creative genius, because most inventions are nothing more than a matter of common sense.</p>
<p>As already stated, to govern is to foresee, and all the great problems that humanity is now facing prove that past governments did not have foresight and were therefore incompetent governments. The problem does not lie with the people who govern, but rather, the technique that is used to choose them: the problem is the way we select those who govern us. Basic democracy must be replaced by a selective democracy — that is geniocracy, which puts intelligent people in power. This is a very fundamental requirement.</p>
<p>Human laws are indispensable, and you will respect them, while seeing to it that those that are unfair or obsolete are changed.</p>
<p>Between human laws and those of our creators, you will not hesitate one instant, as even the human judges will be judged some day by our creators.</p>
<p>The police will be essential for as long as it takes society to discover the medical means to eradicate violence and prevent criminals or those who infringe the freedom of others from acting out their anti-social impulses.</p>
<p>Unlike soldiers, who are the keepers of war, police officers are the keepers of peace, and they will remain indispensable until science has solved this problem.</p>
<p>In countries where compulsory military service exists, you will refuse to participate. Instead, ask to be granted the status of a conscientious objector, which will allow you to serve in a division that does not carry weapons, as is your right if your religious or philosophical convictions forbid you to kill your fellow human beings. This is the case for those who believe in the Elohim, our creators, and want to follow the directives of the Guide of Guides of the Raelian Movement.</p>
<p>Contrary to what many young people think, conscientious objectors are not sent to jail, but serve instead in some civilian role or in an unarmed division for a period that is double the normal duration of military service.</p>
<p>It is better to spend two years working in an office than to be trained for one year in techniques that enable you to kill fellow human beings.</p>
<p>Military service must be eliminated urgently in all the countries of the world. All professional soldiers must be transformed into guardians of world peace who work in the service of freedom and human rights.</p>
<p>The only system of government that is worthwhile is geniocracy applying humanitarianism. Capitalism is wrong because it enslaves people to money, benefiting a few on the backs of others.</p>
<p>Communism is also wrong, since it places greater importance on equality than on liberty. There must be equality among people at the beginning, at birth, but not afterwards.</p>
<p>Although everyone has the right to have sufficient means to live decently, those who do more for their fellow human beings have the right to receive more than those who do nothing for the community.</p>
<p>This is obviously a temporary rule until human beings can have robots to perform all menial labor, so that they can devote themselves exclusively to their fulfillment, after having totally abolished money.</p>
<p>In the meantime, it is shameful that while some people are dying of hunger, others throw food away to prevent prices collapsing. Instead of throwing away this food, they should distribute it to those who have nothing to eat.</p>
<p>Work must not be considered sacred. Everyone has the right to live comfortably, even if they do not work, and should try to fulfill themselves and blossom in whatever field attracts them. If people are organized, it will not take them long to mechanize and automate all indispensable work. Then everybody will be able to blossom freely.</p>
<p>If all individuals really set their minds to it, in only a few years freedom from the need to work could be attained. What is required is a marvelous burst of enthusiasm and solidarity in working for the liberation of humankind from material constraints.</p>
<p>All humanity's technical and scientific resources should be pooled, and all those working in these areas should truly set their minds on striving together for the well being of the entire community, rather than for vested interests. Use all the resources, which are currently wasted on military budgets or the inane development of nuclear weapons — or even flights into space. Such things could be better  planned and much more easily accomplished once humanity is free of material constraints.</p>
<p>You have computers and electronic equipment that can better replace manpower. Put them all to work, so that this technology can truly operate in the service of humankind. In a few years you can build a completely different world. You have reached the golden age.</p>
<p>Do everything possible to create the biological robot that will release you from all menial labor and enable you to blossom and fulfill yourselves.</p>
<p>Urban development must be reconsidered, as it is described in <em>The</em> <em>Book Which Tells The Truth</em>. You must build very tall communal houses situated in open country, so that individual houses do not &quot;devour&quot; nature. Never forget that if everyone had a country house with a small garden, there would be no more countryside. These communal houses must be cities that are equipped with everything people need and be capable of accommodating about 50,000 inhabitants each.</p>
<p>Until the day you become creators and can re-create it yourselves, you must respect nature. By respecting nature, you respect those who created it — our parents, the Elohim.</p>
<p>You will never make animals suffer. You may kill them to feed on their flesh, but do this without making them suffer. Although as already indicated, death is nothing, suffering is an abomination, and you must avoid making animals suffer, as you must prevent human beings from
suffering.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, do not eat too much meat, and you will feel better for it.</p>
<p>You may live on all that the land provides. You do not have to follow a special diet; you may eat meat, vegetables, fruits and other plants. But it is foolish to follow a vegetarian diet under the pretext that you do not want to live on the meat of other living creatures.</p>
<p>Plants are alive just as you are, and suffer in the same way that you do.</p>
<p>You must not cause suffering to plants that are alive, just as you are.</p>
<p>Do not intoxicate yourself with alcoholic beverages. You may drink a little wine while eating, for it is a product of the Earth. But never intoxicate yourself. You may drink alcoholic beverages in exceptional circumstances, but in very small quantities and accompanied by solid food so that you never get drunk. Anyone who is drunk is no longer capable of being in harmony with infinity, nor able to control himself.</p>
<p>This is something appalling in the eyes of our creators.</p>
<p>You will not smoke, for the human body was not made to inhale smoke. This has appalling effects on the organism and prevents total fulfillment and harmonization with infinity.</p>
<p>You will not use drugs. You will not drug yourself in any way, for the awakened mind needs nothing outside itself to approach infinity.</p>
<p>It is an abomination in the eyes of our creators that people think they must take drugs to improve themselves. Human beings have no need to improve themselves because all are perfect, having been made in the
image of our creators.</p>
<p>To say that a human being is imperfect is to insult our creators who made us in their image. But although we are perfect, we cease to be so if we think of ourselves as imperfect and remain resigned to such thoughts.</p>
<p>To remain perfect as the Elohim created us, we need to make an effort at every moment of the day to keep ourselves in an awakened state.</p>
<h3 id="meditation-and-prayer"><a class="header" href="#meditation-and-prayer">Meditation and Prayer</a></h3>
<p>You should meditate at least once each day, locating yourself in relation to infinity, in relation to the Elohim, to society, and yourself.</p>
<p>You should meditate upon awakening, so that your whole being becomes fully conscious of infinity, and you are placed in full possession of all your faculties.</p>
<p>You should meditate before each meal, so that all parts of your body eat when you eat; and when you nourish yourself, think of what you are doing.</p>
<p>Your meditation will not be a dry meditation, but on the contrary, a sensual meditation. You will let yourself be engulfed by peace and harmony until it becomes a pleasurable delight. Your meditation should not be forced labor, but a pleasure. It is better not to meditate at all than to meditate without really wanting to do so.</p>
<p>Do not impose meditation on your children or your family. But explain to them the pleasure that it gives and the sense of well-being that it brings, and if they then feel like meditating, try to teach them what you know.</p>
<p>Think intensely of the Elohim, our creators, at least once a day, and try to communicate with them telepathically. In this way you will rediscover the original meaning of prayer. If you do not know how to go about it, you can take your inspiration from the Lord's Prayer, the words of which are perfectly appropriate for communication with our creators.</p>
<p>At least once a week attempt group telepathic communication with the Elohim alongside other people from your region who believe in them. If possible, you should be accompanied by a Guide.</p>
<p>Do your very best every year to attend the meeting of all those who believe in the Elohim and in the message they have given to the last of the prophets.</p>
<h3 id="technique-for-attempting-telepathic-contact-with-the-elohim"><a class="header" href="#technique-for-attempting-telepathic-contact-with-the-elohim">TECHNIQUE FOR ATTEMPTING TELEPATHIC CONTACT WITH THE ELOHIM</a></h3>
<p>Here is a model of what you could say while looking towards the sky and thinking intensely about the words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elohim, you are there somewhere near those stars.</p>
<p>Elohim, you are there, and I know you are watching us.</p>
<p>Elohim, you are there, and I would so much like to meet you.</p>
<p>Elohim, you are there, and what am I to hope to deserve a contact?</p>
<p>Elohim, I recognize you as our creators, and I place myself humbly at your service.</p>
<p>Elohim, I recognize Claude Rael, your messenger, as my guide, and I believe in him and in the message you gave him.</p>
<p>Elohim, I will do my best to make the message known to those around me because I know I have not done enough.</p>
<p>Elohim, I love all human beings as my brothers and sisters because they are made in your image.</p>
<p>Elohim, I am trying to bring them happiness by opening their minds to infinity and revealing to them what was revealed to me.</p>
<p>Elohim, I am trying to stop their suffering by placing my whole being at the service of humankind, of which I am a part.</p>
<p>Elohim, I am trying to use to the utmost the mind you have given me, to help humankind emerge from darkness and suffering.</p>
<p>Elohim, I hope that you will judge the little I have done by the end of my life to be sufficient to grant me the right to eternal life on the planet of the wise.</p>
<p>I love you, as you must have loved human beings to admit the best of them among your eternals.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-arts"><a class="header" href="#the-arts">The Arts</a></h2>
<p>Do as much as possible to encourage artists and to help your child if he or she is attracted by the arts. Art is one of the things which best enables you to harmonize with infinity. Consider every natural thing an art, and every art a natural thing. Surround yourself with artistic things, whether they appeal to your ears, your eyes, your sense of touch, smell or taste.</p>
<p>Everything, which appeals to the senses, is artistic. There is more than just music, painting, sculpture and all the officially recognized arts.</p>
<p>Gastronomy is also an art, as well as perfume making, since they both appeal to the senses. Standing above all finally, love is an art.</p>
<p>All art makes use of harmony, and therefore allows those who appreciate it to be taken over by something harmonious. This consequently produces the right conditions for placing oneself in harmony with infinity.</p>
<p>Literature is particularly important because it contributes to opening people's minds by showing them new horizons. But literature for literature's sake is just prattle: what counts is not writing beautiful sentences, but the transmission of new ideas to others through reading. Audiovisual means are even more important, for they appeal to our senses of sight and hearing at the same time. They could well replace literature, since they are more complete.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, literature is useful for the time being.</p>
<h2 id="sensual-meditation"><a class="header" href="#sensual-meditation">Sensual Meditation</a></h2>
<p>If you want to reach a high level of harmony with infinity, arrange a place of sensual meditation for yourself. Place in it works of art, paintings, reproductions, tapestries, posters, sculptures, drawings, photographs or anything else that is intended to represent love,
infinity and sensuality, for the enjoyment of your eyes.</p>
<p>Arrange for yourself a corner where you can sit close to the ground, on cushions, for example. Or lie down on a couch or on fur, for the pleasure of touching it. Evaporate agreeable scents and oils to please your nose. Have a tape recorder and a cassette on which you have recorded music that you like for the pleasure of your ears.</p>
<p>Have trays and bottles filled with food and drink that you like for the pleasure of your mouth, and invite one or several people you love, who share your tastes and with whom you feel at ease and in</p>
<p>harmony; then feed your senses together and open your bodies in order to open your minds in love and fraternity.</p>
<p>If someone appeals to you physically, and you feel that it is reciprocal, invite him or her to this place. Together you can reach a sublime state of harmony, which will enable you to approach infinity by satisfying your five senses. To this state will be added the synthesis of all these pleasures — the physical union of two individuals in total harmony and in the illumination of the act of love.</p>
<p>Obviously, the harmony must first exist spiritually. In other words, there must be a mutual attraction between the minds, and thus, the bodies of the individuals in the way they approach and respect each other. But a spiritual love is always made sublime by a fulfilled physical love. To love is to give and expect nothing in exchange. If you love somebody, you should give yourself to this person entirely if he or she desires it.</p>
<p>Never be jealous, for jealousy is the opposite emotion to love.</p>
<p>When you love someone, you must seek his or her happiness first and foremost, and in every way. To love is to seek the happiness of others, and not your own.</p>
<p>If the person you love is attracted to another, do not be jealous; on the contrary, be happy that the one you love is happy, even if it is because of somebody else.</p>
<p>Love also the person who, like you, wants to bring happiness to the person you love, and who therefore has the same goal as you. Jealousy is the fear that someone else may make the person you love happier than you do yourself, and that you may lose the one you love. But instead of feeling jealous, we should try to do as much as possible to make the person we love happy, and if somebody else succeeds better in this, we should be happy about it. What counts is not that our beloved be happy because of us but simply that they be happy, whoever is responsible.</p>
<p>So if the person you love is happy with somebody else, rejoice in this happiness. You will recognize the person who loves you in that he or she will not oppose your happiness with someone else.</p>
<p>It is your duty to love the person who loves you that much and to give him or her happiness yourself. In that direction lies the path of universal love.</p>
<p>Do not reject someone who wants to make you happy, for by accepting that he does so, you make him happy, and this is an act of love. Rejoice in the happiness of others, so that they may rejoice in yours.</p>
<h2 id="human-justice"><a class="header" href="#human-justice">Human Justice</a></h2>
<p>Between human laws and those of our creators, you will not hesitate one instant, as even the human judges will be judged some day by our creators.</p>
<p>Human laws, as already stated, are essential. But they must be improved upon because they do not take love and fraternity sufficiently into consideration.</p>
<p>The death penalty must be abolished because no individual has the right to kill another coldly in a premeditated, organized manner.</p>
<p>Until the time comes when through science, society is able to control the violence that occurs in some people and can cure them of their illness, you will keep criminals apart from society. Then give them the love that they have lacked, while trying to make them understand the monstrous nature of their actions. Give them also the desire to redeem themselves.</p>
<p>Do not mix hardened criminals —who are suffering from an illness that can be contagious— with people who have merely committed petty offenses. That way you will avoid contaminating the lesser offenders.</p>
<p>Never forget that all criminals are sick, and always consider them as such. We are shocked when we remember that once upon a time we used to suffocate people between mattresses if they suffered from fits of hysteria. Some day, when we are able to cure, and more importantly, prevent the sickness of crime, we will be just as shocked when we look back at how we used to execute criminals.</p>
<p>Forgive those who have done you harm unintentionally, and bear no grudge against those who have willingly done you harm. They are ill, for one must be ill to harm one's neighbor. Besides, think how unfortunate those people are, who do harm others, because they will not have the right to eternal life in the gardens of the Elohim.</p>
<p>But if someone wants to harm you or those you love, try to subdue them. If you cannot, then you have the right to defend yourself to save your own life or the lives of your loved ones. However, never strike with the intention to kill, even in legitimate defense. Try only to render the person harmless — by knocking him or her out, for example. If the blow you give turns out to be fatal, you have nothing to blame yourself for, as long as you did not have the intention to kill.</p>
<p>You will subdue violent people by non-violence, and if necessary, by direct action. Violent behavior is intolerable, and you will not tolerate it, even if you have to forcibly restrain violent people. But always use a non-violent force, that is to say, a balanced force applied without malicious intent, sufficient only to overcome those who try to do harm.</p>
<p>Any threat of violence should be treated as seriously as an actual violent deed. To threaten violence is to think it possible and to see it as an acceptable way of achieving one's goals. A person capable of threatening another with violence is as dangerous as someone who has already committed a violent act. Until we can find a medical cure for those who make such threats, they must be kept outside society, and
we must try to make them understand that their behavior is dreadful.</p>
<p>When dealing with those who take hostages, think first of the lives of innocent people who are in the hands of the hostage-takers. People who take hostages are sick, and you should not give them what they demand. Society, in fact, must never give in to them because by doing so, you encourage other criminals to copy such actions and give credence to their threats.</p>
<p>All human beings must have equal rights and opportunities at birth, whatever race they may be. Discriminate against fools, however, whatever the color of their skin. All the races that populate the Earth were created by the Elohim, and must be equally respected.</p>
<p>Humanity as a whole must unite to form a world government, as it is written in <em>The Book Which Tells The Truth</em>. Impose also a new world language on all the school children of the entire world.</p>
<p>Esperanto exists, and if no one proposes anything better, choose Esperanto.</p>
<p>Until it becomes possible to abolish money, create a new world currency to replace national currencies. Therein lies the solution to the monetary crisis. If no one can propose anything better, use the federalist system. Create a federation from all the countries of the world. Grant independence to regions, which need to be able to organize themselves as they wish.</p>
<p>The world will live in harmony when it is no longer composed of separate countries, but consists instead of regions united in a federation to take charge of the destiny of the Earth.</p>
<h2 id="science"><a class="header" href="#science">Science</a></h2>
<p>Science is the most important thing of all for humanity. You will keep yourself in touch with the advances made by scientists who can solve all problems. Do not let scientific discoveries fall into the hands of those who think only of making profit, nor into the hands of the military who keep certain inventions secret in order to retain a hypothetical supremacy over illusory enemies.</p>
<p>Science should be your religion, for the Elohim created you scientifically.</p>
<p>By being scientific, you please your creators because you are acting as they do, and you show them that you understand that you were made in their image and are anxious to take advantage of all the potential that you have within you. Science must be used to serve and liberate humankind, not to destroy and alienate it. Trust those scientists who are not being manipulated by financial interests, and only them.</p>
<p>You may participate in sports, for they are very good for your equilibrium — particularly those sports that develop self-control.</p>
<p>Society should also authorize violent, and even very violent, sports.</p>
<p>These are safety valves. An evolved and non-violent society must have violent games that maintain an image of violence, enabling young people who wish it, to be violent with others who wish the same thing. This also allows others to watch these violent exhibitions and so release their aggressive energies.</p>
<p>You may participate in games that require thought and use of the mind. But as long as money has not been abolished, never play to win money; rather play for the pleasure of making your mind function.</p>
<p>You will date your writings counting the year 1946 as &quot;year one&quot;, after Claude Rael, the last of the prophets. Then 1976 is therefore year 31 after Claude Rael, or year 31 of the era of Aquarius, or year 31 of the age of the Apocalypse, or year 31 of the golden age.</p>
<h2 id="the-human-brain"><a class="header" href="#the-human-brain">The Human Brain</a></h2>
<p>We still have a long way to go in fully understanding the potential of the human brain. The sixth sense, direct perception, should be developed in young children. This is what we call telepathy. Telepathy enables us to communicate directly with our creators, the Elohim.</p>
<p>Numerous mediums have come to me asking what they should do, because they had received messages from what they call &quot;the beyond&quot;, asking them to get in touch with me in order to help me, and for me to bring them &quot;the light&quot;. Mediums are very important people because they have an above average gift of telepathy, and their minds are already on the path to an awakened state. They should try to practice meditation in order to fully master their potential.</p>
<p>I am eagerly waiting for all those mediums who have received such messages to get in touch with me, so that we may organize regular meetings. The true mediums who seek to be informed will all receive instructions. The power of one brain is great, but the power of several brains is infinite. Let those who have ears, hear.</p>
<p>Never forget that all those things, which you do not understand and which scientists cannot explain, have been created by the Elohim.</p>
<p>The clockmaker knows all the parts of the clock he has made.</p>
<h2 id="the-apocalypse"><a class="header" href="#the-apocalypse">The Apocalypse</a></h2>
<p>Do not forget that the Apocalypse —literally the &quot;age of revelation&quot;— has arrived as was predicted. It has been said that when the time comes, there will be many false prophets. You only have to look around you to see that the time has indeed come. False prophets are writers of horoscopes of which the newspapers are full, and there are also many others who reject the benefits of science and cling to every last letter of ancient writings that were the messages given by the Elohim to the primitive people of ancient times.</p>
<p>Such false prophets prefer to believe what narrow-minded and primitive people have fearfully copied down long ago while listening to those whom they considered to be gods because they came from the sky. They should instead believe the message of the Elohim that has been given now to people who no longer kneel stupidly before all that comes from the sky. These latter people try to understand the universe, and they can be addressed as adults.</p>
<p>But if you look around, you will see the crowds of fanatic and obscurantist religious sects, which attract young impressionable people thirsty for the truth.</p>
<p>A philosopher once said: 'Jesus came to show people the path to follow, and everybody kept staring at his finger.' Meditate on this sentence. It is not the messenger who matters, but the person who sends the message, and the message itself.</p>
<p>Do not go astray among the sects of the East — the truth is not on top of the Himalayas any more than in Peru or elsewhere. The truth is within you.</p>
<p>But if you want to travel, and you like exotic places, go to all these distant countries. You will understand then that you have wasted your time, and that what you were looking for was inside you all the time.</p>
<p>Travel within yourself, otherwise you are only a tourist — someone who passes by and thinks he or she will find the truth by watching others search for it within themselves. They may find it, perhaps, but those watching them certainly will not. To travel inside yourself, you do not need to take a plane.</p>
<p>The East has nothing to teach the West about wisdom and awakening the mind. Rather, the opposite is true. How can you find wisdom amongst people who die from hunger as they watch herds of sacred cows go by?</p>
<p>On the contrary, it is the West with its intellect and its science that comes to help people who, for ages, have been shackled by primitive and murderous beliefs. It is not by chance that countries in the West no longer face the same problems as those of the Third World. Where the mind rules, the body does not die of hunger. Where obscurantism  prevails, the body cannot survive. Can primitive people solve the problems of famine in the world and give food to those who are starving? They already have enough difficulties trying to feed themselves, and you expect to find wisdom there?</p>
<p>All the people of the Earth had the same chances at the beginning.</p>
<p>Some have solved their problems, and even have more than they need, while others simply do not have the means to survive. In your opinion, which ones can help the others? The people of the West still have an enormous distance to go on the path of open-mindedness, but the people of the East have not achieved one tenth of what the people of the West have achieved.</p>
<h2 id="telepathic-communication"><a class="header" href="#telepathic-communication">Telepathic Communication</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Mind and matter are eternally the same thing.</p>
<p><em>— The Tibetan Book of the Dead</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to have telepathic communication of a very high quality, do not cut your hair or your beard. Certain people have a telepathic organ that is sufficiently developed to work well even if their head is shaved. But if you want to achieve the best results, then do not cut what the creators have made grow on your head and face. If it grows, there is a reason, for none of your physical characteristics were given to you without reason. By respecting the creation, you respect the creator.</p>
<p>The best moment to enter into communication with your creators is on waking because as your body is emerging from sleep, your mind is re-awakening too. A mechanism starts up at that point, a mechanism, which you must activate by deliberately opening your mind as far as possible to everything around you and to infinity. You should take special care not to halt the process.</p>
<p>Sit down cross-legged, or better still, lie on your back on the ground. If possible, position yourself in the open air and look up towards the sky.</p>
<p>The mind is like a rose. In the morning, it begins to open, but you often prune it when it is still just a bud. If you would wait a little, it would bloom.</p>
<p>To practice physical fitness is good, but to practice the physical fitness of the mind is better.</p>
<p>Yet, do not be impatient if you do not obtain results right away.</p>
<p>When an organ is not used, it atrophies. When you have had a limb in plaster for a long time, you need a lot of physical therapy to recover its normal use.</p>
<p>Look up to the sky and think of your position in the context of everything that surrounds you. Visualize yourself in relation to the house that you occupy, a tiny speck lost between stone walls. See yourself in relation to all the people who are waking up at the same time as you, and in relation to those who, in other parts of the globe, are going to bed. Think of all those who are being born, those who are uniting with each other physically, those who are suffering, working or dying at that time, all this while you are waking up.</p>
<p>Situate yourself in regard to your own level.</p>
<p>Situate yourself in relation to the infinitely large as well. Think of the town where you are, a tiny speck lost in a landscape that is the country, the continent or the island where you live. Then fly away in your mind, as if you were in a plane travelling further and further away from the ground, until the town and then the continent are nothing but a tiny spot.</p>
<p>Be aware of the fact that you are on the Earth, a small ball where humanity is but a parasite. It is always spinning although you do not realize this is happening. Situate yourself in relation to it, and in relation to the moon, which is revolving around the Earth, and in relation to the Earth, which is revolving around the sun, and in relation to the sun, which is itself rotating as it revolves around the center of our galaxy. Situate yourself in relation to the stars that are also suns, which have planets orbiting them. On these planets an  infinite number of other beings live, and among them is the planet of our creators, the Elohim, as well as the planet of the eternals, where you may one day be admitted for eternity.</p>
<p>Locate yourself in relation to all those worlds where other living beings live — some more advanced and some more primitive than we are, and in relation to those galaxies which themselves revolve around the center of the universe. Finally, situate yourself in relation to our whole universe, which itself is an atom of an atom of a molecule located perhaps in the arm of somebody who is looking up at the sky, wondering whether there is life on other planets...</p>
<p><em>This is all in relation to the infinitely large.</em></p>
<p>Then situate yourself also in relation to your body, to all its vital organs and the other parts of which it is made up. Think of all those organs that are working without your noticing it, right at this very moment.</p>
<p>Think of your heart, which is beating without your asking it to, your blood, which circulates and irrigates your whole body, and your brain, which enables you to reflect and be conscious of doing so.</p>
<p>Think of all the corpuscles that make up your blood and of all the cells that are being born in your body, those feeling pleasure while reproducing and those that are dying without your knowing it, and perhaps without being conscious that they help form the individual that you are.</p>
<p>Think too of all the molecules that constitute these cells, and the atoms that constitute these molecules, revolving like suns around the center of a galaxy, and of the particles that make up these atoms, and of the particles of these particles on which there is life asking itself if there is life on other planets...</p>
<p><em>This is all in relation to the infinitely small.</em></p>
<p>Place yourself in harmony with the infinitely large and with the infinitely small by radiating love towards what is above and towards what is below, and by being conscious that you yourself are part of infinity. Then by thinking intensely, try to transmit your message of love to the Elohim, our creators; try to transmit to them your wish to see them, to be among them one day, to have the strength to deserve
it, to be among the chosen ones. Then you will feel light and ready to do good around you with all your strength all day long, because you will be in harmony with infinity.</p>
<p>You may also do these exercises in the sensual meditation room during the day, alone or with other people. But the moment when you come closest to perfect harmony with the infinite will occur when this takes place in your room of sensual meditation with someone you love, and you unite yourself physically with him or her, and jointly harmonize yourselves with infinity during your union.</p>
<p>In the evening, when the sky is full of stars and the temperature is mild, lie down on the ground. Look up at the heavens and think intensely of the Elohim, wishing that some day you may deserve to be amongst them, and thinking strongly that you are available and ready to do exactly what they may ask of you, even if you do not clearly understand why they are asking it. Perhaps you will see a signal if you are sufficiently ready.</p>
<p>As you are lying there on your back, be aware of the extent to which your organs of perception are limited, which explains the difficulty you may have in conceiving of infinity. A force keeps you nailed to the ground, you cannot fly off to the stars with a jerk, and yet you do not see any rope holding you down.</p>
<p>Millions of people are listening to thousands of radio stations and watching hundreds of television programs that are being broadcast in the atmosphere, yet you do not see these waves of sound and vision, and you do not hear them. Compasses all have their points drawn to the north, and yet you neither see nor hear the forces that attract their needles.</p>
<p>So I repeat again: your organs of perception are very limited, and energies like the universe are infinite. Wake yourself up, and wake up the organs you have within you, which will allow you to receive waves that you are not yet picking up or do not even suspect. Simple pigeons are able to find the north, and you, a human being, cannot.</p>
<p>Think about this for a moment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, teach your children, whose organs are developing, all about this. This is how the &quot;new humanity&quot; will be born, and their faculties will be infinitely superior to those of present human beings.</p>
<p>When his growth is finished, a man who has never learned to walk will always be a cripple, and even if he is taught later, he will always be handicapped, even if he is very gifted. Therefore, it is during their growth that you must open the minds of your children, so that all their faculties may blossom, and they will turn into individuals who have nothing in common with what we are: poor, narrow-minded, primitive people.</p>
<h2 id="the-reward"><a class="header" href="#the-reward">The Reward</a></h2>
<p>May this book guide those who recognize and love our creators, the Elohim. May it guide those who believe in them and those who remember to communicate telepathically with them, thus</p>
<p>rediscovering the original meaning of prayer. May it guide those who do good to their fellow human beings. May it guide those who believe in what was revealed to me and in what was revealed before me, and those who are sure that scientific reincarnation is a reality. All such people have a guide and an aim in life, and are happy.</p>
<p>As for those who are not awakened, it is useless to speak to them about this message of the Elohim. One who is asleep cannot hear, and the unconscious mind does not wake up in just a few moments — especially if the person sleeping finds his or her sleep very comfortable.</p>
<p>Spread this message around you to those who do good to their fellow human beings. Spread it particularly among those who, by using the mind that the Elohim gave them, are relieving society from fear of food shortages, disease and the burden of daily exertions. They do this by giving others time to fulfill themselves and blossom, and it is for such individuals that the fountained gardens of the planet of the eternals are reserved.</p>
<p>For it is not enough merely to avoid harming others without doing them any good. Anyone whose life has been neutral will be entitled to neutrality. That is to say, he will not be re-created, neither to pay for crimes which have not been committed, nor to receive the reward for non-existent good deeds.</p>
<p>Anyone who has made many people suffer during part of his life, and then makes up for it by doing as much good as harm, will also be neutral. To have the right to scientific reincarnation on the planet of the eternals, one must have an unambiguously positive assessment at the end of one's life.</p>
<p>To be satisfied with doing good on a small scale around oneself is enough for someone who is not of superior intelligence, or who does not have many means, but it is not enough for someone who is very intelligent or someone who has many means. A very intelligent person has a duty to use the mind given to them by the Elohim to bring happiness to others by inventing new techniques to improve their living conditions.</p>
<p>Those people who will be entitled to scientific reincarnation on the planet of the eternals will live in a world where food will be brought to them without their having to make the slightest effort, and where there will be marvelously beautiful female and male partners scientifically created for the sole purpose of satisfying their pleasures.</p>
<p>They will live there eternally, seeking only to fulfill themselves doing whatever pleases them. As for those who have made others suffer, they will be re-created, and their suffering will be equal to the pleasure of the eternals.</p>
<p>How can you not believe in all this now that science and ancient religions are coming together perfectly? You were nothing but matter, mere dust, yet the Elohim made you into living beings in their image capable of dominating matter. Later you will again become matter or dust, and they will make you live once more as they have created you, scientifically.</p>
<p>The Elohim created the first human beings without knowing that they were doing what had already been done for them. They thought they were only conducting a minor scientific experiment, and that is why they destroyed almost all of humanity the first time.</p>
<p>But when they understood that they had been created just like us, they began to love us as their own children, and swore never to try to destroy us again, leaving us to overcome our own violence by ourselves.</p>
<p>Although the Elohim do not directly intervene for or against humanity as a whole, they do, however, exert influence on some individuals whose actions please or displease them. Woe to those claiming to have met the Elohim or to have received a message from them if it is not true. Their life will become hell, and they will regret their lie when faced with all the troubles they will encounter.</p>
<p>Also those who act against the Guide of Guides and try to prevent him carrying out his mission, or who go along with him in order to spread strife amongst those who follow him, they will also see their life become hell.</p>
<p>Without any obvious influence coming from above, they will know why disease, family and professional difficulties, emotional woes and other problems will all invade their earthly existence while they await their eternal punishment.</p>
<p>You who smile as you read these lines, you are among those who would have crucified Jesus if you had lived in his time. Yet now you want to see members of your family born, get married and die under his effigy because this has become part of the morals and customs.</p>
<p>Behaving like those who went to see the lions devouring the first Christians, you also direct ironic smiles at those who believe in these writings, saying that they should spend some time in a psychiatric asylum. Nowadays, when someone has disturbing ideas, he is no longer crucified or fed to wild animals — this is far too barbaric.</p>
<p>Rather, such people are sent to a psychiatric asylum. Had these establishments existed two thousand years ago, Jesus and those who believed in him would have been confined there. As for those who believe in eternal life, ask them why they weep when they lose a loved one.</p>
<p>For as long as humankind was unable to understand the work of the Elohim scientifically, it was natural for people to believe in an impalpable &quot;God&quot;. But now that, thanks to science, you understand that matter is infinitely large and infinitely small, you no longer have an excuse to believe in the &quot;God&quot; that your primitive ancestors believed in. The Elohim, our creators, intend to be recognized by those who are capable now of understanding how life can be created and can make the appropriate comparisons with ancient writings.</p>
<p>Those people will have the right to eternity.</p>
<p>Christians! You have read a hundred times that Jesus would return, yet if he came back, you would put him in a psychiatric asylum.</p>
<p>Come, open your eyes.</p>
<p>Sons of Israel! You are still waiting for your Messiah, and yet you do not open the door.</p>
<p>Buddhists! Your writings indicate that the new Buddha will be born in the West. Recognize the anticipated signs.</p>
<p>Muslims! Mohammed reminded you that the Jewish people had made an error in killing the prophets, and that the Christians had also made an error in adoring their prophet more than the one who sent him. So welcome the last of the prophets, and love those who sent him.</p>
<p>If you recognize the Elohim as your creators, and if you love them and wish to welcome them, if you try to do good to other people by making as much use as you can of all your potential, if you think of your creators regularly, trying through telepathy to make them understand that you love them, if you help the Guide of Guides to accomplish his mission, you will without a doubt be entitled to scientific reincarnation on the planet of the eternals.</p>
<p>When humanity discovered the necessary form of energy to travel to the moon, it also came to possess sufficient energy to destroy all life on Earth.</p>
<p>'The hour has drawn near, and the moon is rent asunder' it says in the <em>Koran, Sura 54, Verse 1</em>. Therefore, any day now, humanity can destroy itself. Only those who follow the last of the prophets will be saved from destruction.</p>
<p>Long ago, people did not believe Noah, and they laughed at him when he made preparations for the destruction. But they did not have the last laugh.</p>
<p>When the Elohim told the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah to leave the city without looking back, some did not heed those warnings and were destroyed. Now that we have reached the stage when humanity itself may destroy all life on Earth, only those who recognize the Elohim as their creators will be saved from destruction.</p>
<p>You may still not believe any of this, but when the time comes, you will think of these lines again, and it will be too late.</p>
<p>When the cataclysm takes place —and there is a good chance that it will happen quite soon, given the way human beings are presently behaving— there will be two sorts of people: those who have not recognized their creators and have not followed the last of the prophets, and those who have opened their eyes and ears and recognized what was announced a long time ago.</p>
<p>The former will undergo the suffering and destruction in the final furnace, and the latter will be spared and taken with the Guide of Guides to the planet of the eternals. There they will enjoy a marvelous life of fulfillment and pleasure with the sages of ancient times. It is they who will be waited on by magnificent athletes with beautifully sculptured bodies who will bring them sophisticated food to savor in the company of men and women of unequalled beauty and charm who will be entirely compliant to their desires.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seated on couches wrought with gold and jewels, Reclining thereon facing each other,</p>
<p>There will wait on them youths, who will not age,</p>
<p>Carrying goblets and ewers and cups filled out of a flowing spring,</p>
<p>No headache will they get therefrom, nor will they be intoxicated,</p>
<p>And carrying such fruits as they choose,</p>
<p>And flesh of birds as they may desire,</p>
<p>And there will be fair maidens with wide,</p>
<p>Lovely eyes,</p>
<p>Like pearls, we preserved,</p>
<p>As a reward for what they did.</p>
<p><em>The Koran, Sura 56, Verses 15-24.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You who believe in all that is written here, when the Guide of Guides summons you somewhere, drop everything, for it might be because he has received some information concerning the end. If you are near him at that moment, you will be saved and taken away with him, far from the suffering.</p>
<p>You who believe, do not pass judgement on the words or deeds of the Elohim. The created does not have the right to judge his creator.</p>
<p>Respect our prophet, and do not pass judgement on his actions or his words, for we hear through his ears, we see through his eyes, and we speak through his mouth. If you lack respect for the prophet, you lack respect for those who sent him, your creators.</p>
<p>The messages which were given earlier by the Elohim and all those people who adhered fully to them over the centuries were right. But the obscurantist systems that were built on these messages using those who had a feeling for them were wrong. The Church is in the process of disappearing, and it deserves just that.</p>
<p>As for the men and women of the Church, let those who have their eyes open join the last of the prophets and help him spread throughout the world the latest message that has been handed to him.</p>
<p>He will welcome them with open arms, and they will be able to blossom and fulfill themselves completely, while remaining the messengers of those in whom they had always believed. But this time they will at last truly comprehend what the Elohim's task was when they created humanity and when they sent Jesus.</p>
<p>They will really be able to fulfill themselves, far from the constraints of the Church, which is fossilized and encrusted with crimes and criminal inquisitions thousands of years old. They will be able to do what they must do — make use of the organs their creators gave them, for our creators do not like us failing to use the organs they gave us.</p>
<p>The men and women of the Church will be able to enjoy their five senses and unite physically forever, or for an instant of happiness with whomsoever they please, without feeling guilty. It is now that they should feel guilty — guilty of not using all that was given to them by their creators. But released from their old constraints, they will truly open people's minds instead of putting them to sleep!</p>
<p>Already, there are almost no more seminarists, but people who are unhappy — those who have in them the vocation to bring love around them and to open people's minds. Fifty years ago there were 50,000 seminarists; now there are only 500; this means that there are at least 49,500 unhappy people, human beings who have in them the potential, which has been placed in them by our creators so that they use it, to radiate. However, they do not feel attracted to this church shrouded with crimes and darkness.</p>
<p>You who are among those 49,500 people feeling a need to radiate the truth and do something for your fellow people; you who want to remain faithful to your creators and to Jesus who told you to love one another and to respect your creators, <em>&quot;the Father who art in heaven&quot;;</em> you who feel that this message is true, come with us and become Guides, that is to say, people who devote themselves to the Elohim in the tradition of Moses, Elijah and Jesus, and to the spreading of their messages, while continuing to live a normal life, truly fulfilling yourselves and enjoying all the senses that your creators gave you.</p>
<p>You who are presently members of the Church, take off those clothes that are as sad as their color, the color of the crimes that have been committed under their facade. Come with us and become guides for humanity on the path of universal peace and love.</p>
<p>Leave those churches that are nothing but monuments built by primitive people, temples where they could adore worthless things — pieces of wood and metal. The Elohim do not need temples in every city to feel loved. It is sufficient that human beings try to communicate with them telepathically, thereby rediscovering the original meaning of prayer, but also opening themselves to infinity and not shutting themselves away in obscure, mystical stone buildings.</p>
<p>Hypocrisy and mystification have lasted long enough. Using truthful messages as their basis, organizations were built and grew fat on them, living in misplaced luxury and using people's fear to achieve their own ends. Wars were even waged under the pretext of spreading these messages abroad. Shame!</p>
<p>The money of the poor has been used to build a financial power base. Shame!</p>
<p>Love for one's neighbor has been preached with weapons in hand. Shame!</p>
<p>Human equality has been preached while supporting dictatorships. Shame!</p>
<p>'God is with us!' was said to encourage people to launch themselves into fratricidal wars. Shame!</p>
<p>Many times has the following Gospel passage been quoted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.</p>
<p><em>— Matthew 23: 9</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet in the Church they make sure they themselves are constantly called &quot;Father&quot; and &quot;Monsignor&quot; and &quot;My Lord&quot;. Shame!</p>
<p>Other texts have been read again and again that say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses, nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves.</p>
<p><em>— Matthew 10: 9-10.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet they have been wallowing in the luxury of the Vatican. Shame!</p>
<p>The Pope, if he does not sell all the properties of the Vatican to help unfortunate people, will not be admitted among the righteous on the planet of the eternals. It is shameful to wallow in luxury acquired at the expense of poor people by using true messages and by exploiting the births, marriages and deaths of human beings.</p>
<p>If all this changes, and if those people who were a part of that monstrous organization without understanding their mistake now leave it and regret their error, they will be forgiven and entitled to eternity. For the Elohim, our creators, love us, their children, and forgive all those who sincerely regret their errors.</p>
<p>The Church has no reason to exist any longer, for it was entrusted with spreading the message of Jesus in anticipation of the age of the Apocalypse, and this age has now come. Also the Church has used methods of disseminating information that are a shame to it.</p>
<p>Although it has accomplished its mission, the Church will be reproached for all its crimes, and those who still wear its clothes covered with blood will be among the guilty.</p>
<p>Wake up slumberer that you are! This is no fabricated story. Reread all the writings of the ancient prophets, inform yourself about the most recent scientific discoveries —especially in biology— and look at the sky.</p>
<p>The predicted signs are there. The UFOs —unidentified flying objects— which mankind has dubbed &quot;flying saucers&quot;, are appearing every day.</p>
<p>' <em>There will be signs in the sky</em>' — that was written a long time ago. Once you have informed yourself of these things, integrate them all in your mind, and wake up. Claude Rael exists, he is indeed alive, and he has not written what Moses, Ezekiel, Elijah, Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha and all the others wrote. He is not a biologist, but he is the last of the line of prophets, the prophet of the Apocalypse — that is, of the time when everything can be understood.</p>
<p>He is living among you right now; you are lucky enough to be one of his contemporaries, and you are able to receive his teaching. Wake up! Pull yourself together, and take to the road. Go and see him, and help him — he needs you. You will be one of the pioneers of the final religion, the religion of religions, and you will have your place, whatever may happen, among the righteous for eternity, savoring the delights of the planet of the eternals in the company of wonderfully pleasant beings who are ready to fulfill all your desires.</p>
<h2 id="the-guides"><a class="header" href="#the-guides">The Guides</a></h2>
<p>You will follow the Guide of Guides, for he is the ambassador of the Elohim, our creators, &quot;our Fathers who art in Heaven&quot;. You will follow all the advice that is given in this book, because it is the advice of your creators, transmitted by Claude Rael, our ambassador, the last of the prophets, the shepherd of shepherds, and you will help him to build the religion of religions.</p>
<p>Jews, Christians, Muslims, Buddhists and all you who have other religions, open your eyes and your ears; re-read your holy writings, and you will understand that this book is the last one — the one predicted by your own prophets. Come and join us to prepare for the coming of our creators.</p>
<p>Write to the Guide of Guides, and he will put you in touch with other people who, like you, are Raelians — that is, people who understand the message transmitted by Claude Rael. He will put you in touch with a Guide in your region, so that you may meet regularly to meditate and act to spread this message, so that it becomes known throughout the world.</p>
<p>You who are reading this message, be aware that you are privileged, and think of all those who do not yet know about it. Do all you can to make sure that no one around you is ignorant of these fantastic revelations, without ever trying to convince those to whom you speak. Bring this message to their notice, and if they are ready, they will open up by themselves.</p>
<p>Constantly repeat to yourself this sentence of Gandhi: <em>'It's not because no one sees the truth that it becomes an error.'</em></p>
<p>You who feel such joy in reading this message, and who wish to radiate this truth and make it shine around you, you who want to live by devoting yourself totally to our creators, by scrupulously applying what they ask, by training to guide humanity on the path of blossoming and fulfillment, you should become a Guide if you want to be fully capable of this.</p>
<p>Write to the Guide of Guides, to Claude Rael, and he will welcome you and arrange an initiation, which will enable you to radiate this truth fully; for you can open the minds of others only if your own mind is open.</p>
<p>The love of the creators for their work is immense, and you should return this love to them. You must love them as they love you, and prove it by assisting their ambassador and his helpers, putting all your means and all your strength at their service, so that they may travel all over the world to spread this message and build an embassy to welcome our creators.</p>
<p>If you wish to help me realize the goals set by the Elohim, write to me, Rael at:</p>
<p><strong>International Raelian Movement</strong>
<strong>Case Postale 225, CH 1211</strong>
<strong>Geneva 8</strong>
<strong>Switzerland</strong></p>
<p>or by email to: <strong>headquarters@rael.org</strong></p>
<p>Also, do not forget that regular local meetings of people who believe in this final message are held on the first Sunday of April, on the 6th of August, the 7th of October and the 13th of December each year. The venues for these meetings will be set out in the liaison bulletin of the Raelian Movement of your country, and some addresses to help you make contact are listed at the end of this book.</p>
