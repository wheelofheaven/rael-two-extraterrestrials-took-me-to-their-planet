<h2 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>When I started this second book I wanted simply to relate what my life had been like before my fantastic encounter of 13 December 1973, to answer the many people who had asked firstly what I had done before that time, and secondly whether anything extraordinary had happened to me during my childhood that could have foreshadowed such a destiny.</p>
<p>I was surprised myself as I searched my memories, for even though I thought that nothing extraordinary had occurred at the beginning of my life, I found scenes resurfacing, which formed a whole when put together, and I saw that my life had really been guided for me to be what I was and to find myself where I did on December 13, 1973.</p>
<p>I had almost finished writing this account when the second encounter took place. Consequently, I have summed up my early memories briefly in order to give as much space as possible to the second part of this message and to provide a full account of this second contact, which turned out to be even more fantastic than the first.</p>
<h2 id="two-years-have-passed"><a class="header" href="#two-years-have-passed">Two Years Have Passed</a></h2>
<p>Two years! For almost two years now I have been trying somehow to radiate this truth, which is too great for me. Time goes by, and I feel I am getting nowhere. Yet, little by little, a solid core of people is forming around me, people who understand that <em>The Book Which</em> <em>Tells the Truth</em> really does just that.</p>
<p>There are seven hundred of them as I pen these lines, and I understand how this is both few and many at the same time. Few when we consider the four billion people who populate the Earth, and many when we consider how few people had decided, after two years, to follow the man who, two thousand years ago, had the equally heavy burden of being initiated and then initiating the primitive people of his time.</p>
<p>Who are these seven hundred? Are they, as the scoffers would no doubt love to believe, average simpletons who could be made to swallow anything? Not at all. Some of them are university graduates or people holding PhD's in philosophy, psychology, theology, sociology, medicine, physics, chemistry, etc.</p>
<p>My admiration perhaps goes as much to those who have no degree, since although they have not acquired knowledge through studying that would allow them to realize that living matter and people like us can be created scientifically, they are still able to feel it intuitively, as people capable of mastering matter and putting themselves in harmony with the universe that they are.</p>
<p>I must say that I am optimistic on the whole, and that I believe that I have so far accomplished the mission that has been entrusted to me.</p>
<p>For whatever happens to me, MADECH is up and running, and nothing will ever be able to stop it.</p>
<p>In two years I have given nearly forty lectures, and since certain questions come up regularly, I suppose some parts of the message need to be clarified. So I will try to do that in this work.</p>
<p>First of all, what path did I follow before the encounter of 13 December 1973? I have to admit I have only recently begun to look back on my life to figure out exactly how it had been guided for me to be available and ready to go into action on the spiritual, psychic and emotional levels at that time.</p>
<p>Certain events in my childhood had never seemed to me to have the least meaning when taken separately — but they did when taken together.</p>
<p>Now it all seems very clear to me, and I am moved when I remember some things that I considered unimportant at the time they
occurred. Far be it from me to tell my life story in a way that suggests that each event in it was exceptional, but it seems that many people want to know more about what had happened to me before.</p>
<p>Also, rather than leave it to wagging tongues, I would rather tell it all myself.</p>
<h2 id="childhood-a-ufo-over-ambert"><a class="header" href="#childhood-a-ufo-over-ambert">Childhood: a UFO over Ambert</a></h2>
<p>As the child of an unknown father, I cannot say that I had a typical childhood. I was what is called a &quot;natural&quot; child — as if all others were &quot;artificial&quot; children. My birth was an accident as it were, at least for the little town of Ambert, which is so devoutly Catholic that it is known as the &quot;world capital of the rosary&quot;. Furthermore, the unknown father, who was not totally unknown, was apparently a Jewish refugee. What sacrilege!</p>
<p>My birth was concealed as much as possible — not in a cave, but in a clinic at nearby Vichy. It occurred on 30 September 1946 at about two o'clock in the morning and was a very difficult one. But the important thing is that I was conceived on 25 December 1945.</p>
<p>Conception, the moment when a being truly begins to exist and develop in the womb of its mother, is the true date of birth for each individual. December 25 has been a very important date for almost two thousand years now. For those who believe in coincidences, my life began with a coincidence.</p>
<p>When we returned to Ambert, my poor mother tried for quite a long while to pass me off as &quot;the son of a friend she was taking care of for a while&quot; to her father who, even though he held it against her when he learned the truth, proved to be the nicest of grandfathers to me during the short time I knew him. Sadly, he died when I was still a very young child. I was later told about how amused he looked when, having seen him trim his fruit trees, I took a pair of scissors to cut... his lettuce.</p>
<p>I was raised by my grandmother and my aunt who were then, and still are, living together. They taught me to read and helped me take my first steps, which I remember very clearly — surely the earliest memory of my life.</p>
<p>It was only very recently that my grandmother told me that in 1947 she saw a strange craft flying very quickly and noiselessly over Ambert near her house. She had never dared tell anyone about it for fear of being accused of hallucinating. It was only after reading my book that she decided to talk to me about it... and at the same time she decided to join MADECH. Her decision to join was, in fact, one of the most important forms of encouragement that I received.</p>
<h2 id="the-pope-of-the-druids"><a class="header" href="#the-pope-of-the-druids">The Pope of the Druids</a></h2>
<p>In Ambert there was an old man of whom small children were afraid, and of whom the grown-ups made fun. They nicknamed him &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; because he had very long hair rolled up in a bun and a magnificent beard.</p>
<p>He was always clad in a long cape that came down to his ankles, and he lived about a hundred meters from the house where my mother had found a small apartment. He did not work, and nobody knew how he could afford to live in the minuscule house in front of the municipal grammar school.</p>
<p>As they got older, the children lost their fear of him, and like their parents, started to make fun of him, laughing and making faces as they followed at his heels.</p>
<p>Personally, I did not enjoy playing with the others, preferring to contemplate insects and look at books. I had passed this man in the street several times and had been surprised by his face, which radiated great kindness, and by the mischievous smile he wore whenever he looked at me. I did not know why, but he did not scare me, and I did not see anything laughable about him. Also I did not understand why the other children made fun of him.</p>
<p>One afternoon I followed him, curious about where he was going, and saw him go into his house, leaving open the door that led into a small, very dark kitchen. I went closer and could see him sitting on a stool with the mischievous smile on his face, as if he were expecting me. He motioned for me to come nearer. I went inside the house and moved towards him.</p>
<p>He laid his hand on my head, and I felt a strange sensation. At the same time, he looked up in the air and uttered some words that I did not understand. After a few minutes had passed, he let me go, still without saying a word, and still smiling the same mysterious smile.</p>
<p>All this had me puzzled at the time, but I very quickly forgot about it. It was only in the summer of 1974, when reading a book that my mother had lent me about the mysteries of Auvergne, that I learned that Father Dissard, the old man in question, was the last Dissard —that is, the last living &quot;Pope&quot; of the Druids— and that he had been dead for several years.</p>
<p>Then I recalled the scene from my childhood, and thought again of the mysterious smile that the old man used to give me each time I passed him in the street — which was every day, since we had been virtually neighbors. I now know exactly who he was addressing when he looked up in the air and uttered those mysterious phrases, just as I know exactly what the silent, luminous machine was that my grandmother had seen.</p>
<p>One other thing also comes to mind again. After the scene that took place at Father Dissard's house, I went to sleep every evening counting up to nine a certain number of times.</p>
<p>This is a number that has frequently come up in my life, like a code that has been assigned to me. I have never been able to explain this sudden habit, which began several years after I had learned to count much higher than nine, and therefore could not have been the result of learning by rote. I was seven years old when this incident took place.</p>
<h2 id="poetry"><a class="header" href="#poetry">Poetry</a></h2>
<p>At that time what mattered most to me were animals, which I loved to draw all day long, when I was not organizing snail races. I was fascinated by animal life, and I dreamt then only of becoming an explorer, so as to be able to get near the mysterious fauna of the virgin forests.</p>
<p>But at nine years of age —the number nine again— everything was to change. First of all, I was discovering what was to become a true passion for me — speed. Speed that is, on everything with wheels, with or without an engine. Speed and especially balance, the sense of trajectory and the struggle against oneself, against one's own reflexes — in fact, the ultimate mastery of mind over body.</p>
<p>It started with wild downhill runs on a little bicycle with almost no brakes, and I wonder how it was that I did not fall a single time. To liven things up, I would position myself at the top of a hill and wait for a fast car to pass by. Then I would launch into dizzying pursuit, catch up with the car and pass it —to the driver's great surprise— and, once at the bottom of the hill, I would turn and go back to wait at the top for another car.</p>
<p>A few months later, I found myself by chance attending the Tour de France motor race, and it was love at first sight. It was possible, I  then realized, to know the joys of high speed without having to pedal back up a hill. And you could make it your job.</p>
<p>I made up my mind, the way you can when you are nine years old. I would be a race-car driver. From that day on, my life was centered only around motor racing.</p>
<p>Nothing else interested me, and I did not see the point of learning all they taught me at school, since I was going to be a racing driver.</p>
<p>Children's comics were replaced by serious motor magazines, and I impatiently began counting off the years that separated me from the age when I could obtain a driver's license.</p>
<p>It was also at the age of nine that I had my first experience of boarding school. My mother was in despair because I no longer wanted to do anything at school, and I constantly told her that such learning was useless for motor racing drivers. So she decided to send me to the Notre-Dame-de-France boarding school in Puy-en-Velay.</p>
<p>She hoped that, without motor racing magazines, I would apply myself to school work, and in a way she was not far wrong. But I have very bad memories of that first boarding school, almost certainly because I was too young when I was sent there.</p>
<p>I remember that I spent many nights crying in a huge dormitory, where what I now believe I missed most was the chance to be alone and meditate.</p>
<p>This need, which caused me to spend entire nights crying, further increased my already great sensitivity, as will any emotional or affectionate need that is denied. Then I discovered poetry.</p>
<p>I had always been more attracted to literature than to mathematics, although only as an interested and passive reader. Then came the desire, the need to write — in verse if possible. I remained uninterested in mathematics, yet I had now achieved a solid average in that subject as in all others. But in French language, and especially writing, I regularly came first, as long as I liked the set subject. I even wrote an entire collection of poems and won first prize in a poetry competition.</p>
<p>The most surprising thing was that even though I had not been baptized, I was in a private boarding school run by Catholic monks, with all the praying which that involves —prayers before eating, and going to bed, before rising in the morning, before studying— and attending daily mass with communion. When, after six months of daily communion the brethren discovered that I had not been baptized, they seemed utterly horrified. I actually thought it was funny; it was in fact the only part of their mass that I liked, this free tasting of morsels of bread.</p>
<p>It was also at the age of nine that I attained puberty. I enjoyed it very much and discovering unknown and secret pleasures, which no other nine year-old in the dormitory seemed yet to know about, was some consolation for my incomplete solitude.</p>
<p>Finally, it was at the age of nine that I fell in love for the first time — and it was the intense kind of love that can seize children at that age.</p>
<p>Due to my improved classroom results, my mother had agreed not to send me back to boarding school, and I found myself in the fourth grade at the municipal grammar school in Ambert. There she was, nine years old or almost, and her name was Brigitte. I was shy and blushed quite ridiculously. It took only a glance during a medical visit, or perhaps a gesture of modesty to hide a non-existent bosom from my eyes, to release in me feelings of tenderness and a great desire to protect this apparently fragile being.</p>
<p>The following year I found myself at the same school, in the fifth grade, in the company of my first love to whom I dared not even speak. Still, I managed to end up sitting one desk in front of her at the beginning of the school year, so that I could turn my head from time to time and admire her beloved face. I was only ten and was always thinking about her.</p>
<p>The fact that I was close to her in class spurred me on, and I set myself to work hard enough to avoid having to repeat a year. In this way, I moved up to the sixth grade without the least interest in my studies.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we were now constantly changing classes and had different teachers instead of just one. As a result, I was almost always separated from her and did practically no work — so much so that the next year I found myself back in a boarding school in the small village of Cunlhat, which is about thirty kilometers from Ambert.</p>
<p>It was even worse there than it had been at Puy-en-Velay. We were all crammed into a tiny dormitory that was barely heated. and worst of all, there was virtually no discipline. So the biggest and strongest boys enforced their own law. I think that is where I developed such a hatred of violence.</p>
<p>One day, fed up with being bullied by boys against whom no disciplinary measures were ever taken, I took to the road on foot, determined to cover the thirty kilometers that separated me from my maternal home. Nobody noticed my departure, and when the school principal caught up with me in his car, I had already walked nearly ten kilometers.</p>
<p>To my great delight, I was kicked out of the school and sent back to the Catholic brethren at Ambert in the middle of the school year as a day boy. What joy! I could now see Brigitte every day in the street. By then she was twelve, her small bosom was budding deliciously, and to me she was more beautiful than ever.</p>
<p>I grew less and less interested in my studies and began to taste the joys of playing truant, mainly because I did not like finding myself back among the priests, who had quickly advised my mother to have me baptized. Fortunately, she preferred to wait until I was old enough to understand, so that she could ask my opinion.</p>
<p>What I would have liked at that time was to become a garage mechanic because I had learned that this was a useful skill for racing drivers. My mother, who hoped I would become an engineer, wanted me at all costs to continue with my studies, so she would not allow me to become apprenticed to a garage.</p>
<p>This new harassment gave me the desire to write poems again, and I started pacing about in the country with a notebook in my hand instead of attending classes.</p>
<p>At fourteen I found myself back in boarding school once more, this time in Mont-Dore, at a grammar school where they take children not wanted by any of the other schools in the region.</p>
<p>I found myself in the company of a fairly interesting collection of dunces and &quot;hard cases&quot;. It was one of the latter, a typical boarding school &quot;big shot&quot;, who ended up being responsible for the direction I took during the next ten years of my life. His name was Jacques, and he played the electric guitar, which quite impressed me. As soon as the Christmas holidays came, I got my grandmother to buy me a magnificent guitar, and Jacques taught me a few chords. Then I started setting my poems to music and noticed that it was apparently very pleasing to those who listened. As soon as the summer holidays came, I began to enter some radio singing contests, which I almost always won.</p>
<p>It was also during that summer vacation that I discovered physical love for the first time — with a barmaid who had been enchanted by my songs. She was twenty years old and did not teach me much apart from the effects that the guitar can have on women.</p>
<p>The following year I was fifteen and wanted more than ever to live my own life. One day I took my guitar under my arm along with a small suitcase, said farewell to the boarding school with its uninteresting studies, and hitchhiked to Paris. I had two thousand old francs in my pocket and a heart full of hope. At last I was going to earn my own living, save up enough money to take my driving test at the age of eighteen and become a racing driver.</p>
<p>By a stroke of luck a man driving a car that had tremendous acceleration hidden beneath discreet-looking bodywork picked me up. When he told me he was a racing driver and gave me his name, I was able to tell him which car he had driven and the awards he had won. He was flattered and surprised, little known as he was, to meet a young boy who remembered all his achievements. He told me that he had once been a clown, and that he now owned a garage in the southwest. When we arrived in Paris, he invited me out to dinner and even offered me a room in the hotel where he was staying.</p>
<p>In the lounge, we chatted a bit with two young women who were dance hostesses in a bar and had finished their day's work. I sang some songs, and then we went to bed each with one of our charming companions. There I was truly initiated into physical lovemaking.</p>
<p>The next morning, I left discreetly because I wanted to find a room and some cabarets that would be interested in my songs. I did not findeither and spent my second night in Paris in the subway with the tramps.</p>
<p>I had not a penny left, and the next morning, I was starving. I spent my day dawdling and despairing of ever sorting anything out.</p>
<p>But that evening I saw a man playing an accordion on a cafe terrace, and the customers were throwing him coins. I decided to try the same thing, and right from the start, it worked very well. I was saved.</p>
<p>I lived like that for three years, often sleeping anywhere and eating a sandwich from time to time. But I made enormous progress, and one day I was hired by a small cabaret on the Left Bank. I made ten francs each night and needed fifteen for the taxi ride back to Montmartre, where I lived in a small room. Yet I had my name on the poster — although in small print! Already I was imagining my name high up on the poster in big letters, seeing the success I was having every night.</p>
<p>One day I met the actor Jean-Pierre Darras who advised me to take acting classes to improve my stage presence. Since I did not have the means to pay for them, he kindly arranged for me to attend a course at the National Theatre of Paris free of charge. So for three months I took the Dullin course — and then gave it up because I did not feel at all attracted to the theatre.</p>
<p>I used to introduce myself at the time under the pseudonym of Claude Celler, which I had chosen as a tribute to the skier and champion racing driver, Tony Sailer. I modified the spelling so that my initials would become C C. — retaining my real first name.</p>
<p>I began to win a lot of radio contests, and by singing in several cabarets, I was able to live reasonably well, and more importantly, to save up enough money to take my driving test at exactly eighteen, as planned.</p>
<p>But that was not enough to become a racing driver. First I had to make a name for myself in the hope of being hired by a major company, and for that I needed to have a competition car, participate in some races independently and, if possible, win them. A racing car is very expensive, and I had to continue saving in the hope of acquiring such a vehicle. I continued with my singing and tried to put some money aside. Many writer-composer friends had made recordings and seemed to be making a lot of money from them. So I decided to try it, having by now more than 150 songs in my bag.</p>
<p>The first recording firm that I approached offered me a three-year contract, which I signed. The director of the recording firm was Lucien Morisse, the director of the radio station Europe No. 1, which had launched a tremendous number of famous singers. My first record was fairly successful, and the second, thanks to a song called <em>Le Miel et la Canelle</em> (Honey and Cinnamon), was even more popular.</p>
<p>It was often heard on the radio:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HONEY AND CINNAMON</p>
<p><em>I smell honey and cinnamon</em></p>
<p><em>I smell vanilla and love</em></p>
<p><em>I smell honey and cinnamon</em></p>
<p><em>Girls I'll always adore.</em></p>
<p><em>The first was a brunette, Margot was her name</em></p>
<p><em>We played the pipes as the moon lit the night</em></p>
<p><em>I took the road to her eyes</em></p>
<p><em>And followed the way to her hair.</em></p>
<p><em>The second was a blonde, her name was Marielle</em></p>
<p><em>The path around her curves I remember well</em></p>
<p><em>I took the road to her eyes</em></p>
<p><em>And followed the way to her hair.</em></p>
<p><em>The third was a redhead, Marion she was called</em></p>
<p><em>For her lovely little face and her frothy underslip</em></p>
<p><em>I took the road to her eyes</em></p>
<p><em>And followed the way to her hair.</em></p>
<p><em>Don't cry, my friend, for tomorrow will be spring</em></p>
<p><em>They are so lovely and you're not twenty yet</em></p>
<p><em>I took the road to her eyes</em></p>
<p><em>And you can travel the path to her hair.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was giving many performances and taking part in many road  shows. Everything was going well, and I even had the pleasure of being selected to participate in the Golden Rose song contest held in Antibes. But those who were guiding me did not really want me to become too famous an artist. That stage of my life had been planned to develop my sensitivity, and to accustom me to expressing myself in public, but no more than that.</p>
<p>Even though the fact that I was among the contestants selected for the Golden Rose was being announced on the radio every morning, Lucien Morisse came to me one day and explained that he had to withdraw me from the contest. He said that I would understand why later, but he could not tell me more at that moment.</p>
<p>So, in the end, I did not participate in that Golden Rose contest but had to continue to live on what I could earn from my singing, which I realized, would never be enough to buy a car that would get me into racing.</p>
<p>Therefore, when I was offered the opportunity to become a representative for the company where I did my recording, I accepted immediately, convinced that I would be able to save up enough for a car in a few months.</p>
<p>I found myself back in Bordeaux, where I was a commercial agent in charge of fifteen regions. I stayed there for a year and left when at last I had enough money to buy myself a competition car. I just had time to break that car in before a friend wrote it off in an accident.</p>
<p>However, I had composed new songs during the year in Bordeaux, and a wealthy friend urged me to make another record, which he would finance himself.</p>
<p>I spent another year living on my poetry and then, as if to make me change my lifestyle radically, I was involved in a very serious car accident.</p>
<p>On a very tiring tour I fell asleep at the wheel of my car and struck a wall head on, at about 100km per hour — 60 mph. More than ten people had already died at that spot. I came out of it with several fractures, but alive. I was immobilized for three months or more and my savings ran out. I was still not racing. I, who had dreamt of starting out at eighteen, had still not entered a single race by the age of twenty-two.</p>
<p>Having been to racing circuits many times as a spectator, I had noticed how infatuated young people were with this sport, and also the number of boys who wanted to be racing drivers without knowing how to proceed. I did not know much more than they did, and told myself that the best way for me to enter the racing scene would be to find a career that took advantage of their enthusiasm. I knew how to write, so the solution was obvious.</p>
<p>I would become a reporter for a sports car magazine.</p>
<p>I got in touch with a number of specialist magazines, but in vain because so many other young people had come up with the same idea. Then I noticed a small advertisement in the motor section of <em>L'Equipe</em> from someone looking for photographer-reporters, no experience required.</p>
<p>I wrote, and the advertiser replied saying that my application was being considered, but that I had to send 150 francs for administrative costs. In exchange, I would receive some film to make a test report on a subject of my choice. I sent the money, got back the film, wrote the report —on a motor race, of course— and immediately sent it to the address indicated.</p>
<p>Very soon afterwards, I received a letter asking me to call a number in Dijon, where the head office of the firm that had placed the advertisement was situated. I met the head of the publishing company — a man of about thirty years of age who claimed to have made a fortune in photography in the United States.</p>
<p>He seemed to be very interested in my ideas about the creation of a sports car magazine intended for young people who hoped to become racing drivers and offered to hire me as editor-in-chief of a newspaper that was to come out in a few months' time. He showed me the factory that he was going to buy to set up his printing office, introduced me to the printer in Dijon whom he had hired to be the director, and showed me the house where my wife and I could live, at a stone's throw from my office.</p>
<p>I replied that it would suit me, provided I could cover and participate in races. He then told me that he was also looking for someone capable of running a competitions department, since he intended to launch the new newspaper by racing some cars painted in his own colors. That would enable me to be right where the action was, and I agreed to be the director of the competitions department for this company.</p>
<p>A week later, I moved from Paris to Dijon with my wife, Marie-Paul. I had been married for about three months, and she was expecting our daughter. I had met Marie-Paule in the month of June, and we had not left each other's side since the first day we met. We had married three months later, only because her family was shocked to learn that we had no intention of getting married religiously. Her family was very old-fashioned, and at first I prayed with them before meals.</p>
<p>My stay in Dijon, however, lasted only two months, and I received no salary. It transpired that the &quot;rich American&quot; who had wanted to create a newspaper had in fact just come out of prison without a penny. He had swindled sums of money ranging from 150 francs to 300 francs from more than 500 young people dreaming, like me, of becoming racing drivers or photographer-reporters.</p>
<p>I had worked two months for nothing, and I found myself full of ideas, but penniless. This time I decided to make a start alone in the great world of publishing. I moved to Clermont-Ferrand, close to my mother who was then looking forward to becoming a grandparent very soon, and started my own publishing house to produce a magazine in my own way. This magazine was soon born, thanks to a printer who also loved sports cars and who agreed to take the risk of extending me credit, although I could not give him any form of guarantee.</p>
<p>The magazine took off quickly and soon became one of the leaders in its field. I reserved for myself the most interesting task — test driving new models on the magnificent circuit of Mas-du-Clos, at Creuse, and on the road. By this means I gained entry into the world of motor sport, and cars were lent to me to race. At last my dream was becoming a reality, and what is more, I found from the start that I was a gifted competition driver, gaining many victories with cars that were unfamiliar to me.</p>
<p>For three marvelous years I lived like this, all the time making continuous progress with my driving technique and concentrating 100 per cent on the field that I loved — that of sports cars. I must say that I felt a real pleasure in steadily pushing back my limitations and constantly improving control of my reflexes and reactions. However, I did not care for either engine noise or the smell of burning fuel, and I dreamed of days to come when racing car manufacturers would be required to make their cars odorless and noiseless. Only then could I enjoy fully the sensation of driving at its purest level.</p>
<p>But all this was turned upside down towards the end of 1973.</p>
<h2 id="the-encounter"><a class="header" href="#the-encounter">The Encounter</a></h2>
<p>On that extraordinary day, 13 December, 1973, I found myself in a crater of an Auvergne volcano, the Puy-de-Lassolas. There, as I have already described, I met for the first time an extra-terrestrial man, or more precisely, the Eloha —singular of Elohim— whom I would meet at the same place for six consecutive days and who, for about one hour each time, would dictate to me the fantastic revelations of <em>The Book Which Tells The Truth</em>.</p>
<p>For the first few days following this experience I must confess I wondered if I would dare tell anyone at all about it. The first thing I did was to make a neat copy of the notes that I had taken as best I could, although far too quickly as my interlocutor spoke to me.</p>
<p>When this was finished, I sent the original manuscript to a serious publisher who to my knowledge did not publish esoteric works or science fiction. Obviously I did not want this message of such importance to humanity to be lost among collections of mysterious adventure stories or occult books that cater for people interested in alternative sciences.</p>
<p>Marcel Jullian, who ran the publishing house, invited me to Paris and told me that the manuscript was sensational. But he said that I must tell my life story before talking about the message, and that there might be &quot;a few little changes to be made&quot;.</p>
<p>All that was absolutely out of the question. I did not want to take up a hundred pages telling my life story and then present the message that I had received, as if my personality were as important as those things which I had been asked to reveal. I wanted the message published, but only the message, even if it was not a thick book and thereby lacked interest for a publisher. So I asked Monsieur Jullian to return my manuscript. He replied that he did not have it because a reader had borrowed it, but that as soon as it was returned he would mail it to me. </p>
<p>I had just returned to Clermont-Ferrand when I received a telegram inviting me to return to Paris to appear in a television show named the <em>Great Chess Board</em>, presented by Jacques Chancel. He was the director of a series in the publishing house to which I had sent my manuscript. He had read it and understood that it was absolutely fantastic, whether anyone believed it or not. So I took part in the show, and the thousands of letters that I received afterwards showed that, while some laughed, many had taken what I said very seriously and wanted to help.</p>
<p>But days went by, and my manuscript was not returned. I sent a registered letter to the publisher, who replied that the manuscript would be sent to me, but that they had not yet found it. After ten days I went back to Paris to see if I could do something personally because nobody wanted to answer my questions any more when I telephoned to ask about the matter.</p>
<p>The famous designer, Courrèges, who had contacted me after the television show because he was interested, agreed to come with me to see the publisher in order to find out what exactly had become of the manuscript.</p>
<p>Marcel Jullian told us that the reader who had the manuscript had taken it with him on holiday, but they did not know where he was or how to reach him. The situation was becoming stranger and stranger.</p>
<p>In the end the manuscript was retrieved by Monsieur Courrèges, and he returned it to me personally. I still wonder if it had really been lost or just put away to prevent it from being published. If that publishing house really mislaid the manuscript so easily, then I would discourage other authors from sending their originals to them.</p>
<p>Alarmed by the mishap and by the growing pile of letters from people interested in buying the book containing the message as soon as it was published, Marie-Paule offered to leave her nursing job to help me with the publishing and distribution of this exceptional document.</p>
<p>I accepted because I was sure that this way, I would have permanent control over the use of these writings. Since it was incompatible with the seriousness of the mission that I had been given, I immediately stopped working for the sports magazine, and in the autumn of 1974, the book finally rolled off the printing press.</p>
<p>The shock to my nervous system caused by this unforeseen upset in my life had given me stomach pains and almost brought on an ulcer. All winter I suffered from a serious case of gastritis. No medication was effective, and it was only after I decided to take it easy by doing some meditation and breathing exercises that the pains vanished, as if by magic.</p>
<p>In June, I had been on a television show hosted by Philippe Bouvard. It was called <em>Saturday Evening,</em> and sarcastic as always, Monsieur Bouvard disguised his co-host as a Martian with pink antennae and a green suit, and asked me if he looked like the person I had met.</p>
<p>But many people, interested by the little I had been able to say, wrote to Philippe Bouvard, reproaching him for his lack of seriousness. Confronted by the thousands of letters he received, he decided to invite me back to do another show where I would be able to say a little more. Convinced that I would not be allowed to say enough, I decided to hire the Pleyel Hall for a date just after the television show and to announce to interested viewers that I would give a talk there in a few days' time. I hired a hall to seat 150, with an option on another to seat 500, as I did not know how many people would want to bother to come and listen to me.</p>
<p>In the end, more than 3,000 people came. Quite obviously we could only accommodate 500 in the hall I had booked, and when these seats were filled, we advised the others that I would give another talk in a few days in the great hall with 2,000 seats. Obviously, many people were not happy to leave, some of them having traveled several hundred kilometers.</p>
<p>In the end, everything went well, and I found that a great number of people were ready to help and support me, apart, of course, from those cynics whose questions, by virtue of their superficiality, I was able to show up as ridiculous.</p>
<p>Even though I had dreadful stage fright, much more than I had ever had when singing, everything went without a hitch, and the answers to the most difficult questions seemed to come to my lips by themselves. I really felt help coming from above, just as the Elohim had promised me. I had the impression of listening to myself give answers that I could not possibly have come up with alone.</p>
<p>The second talk took place a few days later. I was afraid that those who had not been able to get into the hall the first time would not come back, and that I would therefore find myself stuck with a very expensive hall nearly three quarters empty especially since there had not been any publicity about it since the television program, except for a short, three-line paragraph in <em>France Soir</em>, the only newspaper that would agree to publicize this second talk.</p>
<p>In the end, well over two thousand people came, and the hall was full. It was a triumph. From this time onward, I did not have any further doubts about the success of my mission.</p>
<h2 id="the-public-talks"><a class="header" href="#the-public-talks">The Public Talks</a></h2>
<p>From the month of September 1974 onwards, over the course of some forty lectures, I was able to see which questions came up most frequently. I also saw the membership of MADECH rising constantly, as regional offices formed in all the big towns of France around the most dynamic and active members.</p>
<p>I also saw some reporters pursuing their craft honestly and well, their job being to inform the public by writing or saying exactly what they had seen or read about. However, some like those from the newspaper, <em>Le Point</em>, wrote lies. Even after registered letters were sent to remind them that they had to rectify an inaccurate article in conformity with the right to respond, they did not do so properly.</p>
<p>Others, like those at the newspaper, <em>La Montagne</em>, simply refused to inform their readers that I was giving a talk in Clermont-Ferrand and exploited the fact that they were the only daily newspaper in that region. Their news director had in fact met me and said that never would my activities or I be mentioned in his newspaper. All this was because they did not like the fact that when I appeared initially on television, I had not first informed them before talking to a major French broadcasting organization — a sad story and a fine example of freedom of speech. They even refused to run a paid advertisement announcing that talk, although in the same newspaper there were full-page advertisements for pornographic movies.</p>
<p>As for the newspaper, <em>Le Point</em>, it simply transformed an excursion of MADECH members to the place where the encounter had occurred into a broken appointment with the Elohim.</p>
<p>These tricks were played in an attempt to ridicule an organization trying to get off the ground. It is evidently easier and less dangerous for a newspaper with an extensive readership to do this to a new organization like MADECH than to the Church, with its 2,000 years of usurpation.</p>
<p>But the day will come when those who have tried to hide or twist the truth will regret their mistakes.</p>

<h1 id="the-second-encounter"><a class="header" href="#the-second-encounter">THE SECOND ENCOUNTER</a></h1>
<h2 id="the-sighting-of-july-31st-1975"><a class="header" href="#the-sighting-of-july-31st-1975">The Sighting of July 31st, 1975</a></h2>
<p>It was during June 1975 that I decided to resign as president of MADECH, first of all because it seemed that the movement could now manage very well without me, and secondly because I thought I had made a mistake in structuring the organization in accordance with a 1901 law that likened the movement, which is of such importance to humanity, to a petanque club or a war veterans' association.</p>
<p>I thought it was necessary to create a movement more in harmony with the fantastic message the Elohim had transmitted to me. This required a movement that respected to the letter what our creators had advised — namely geniocracy, humanitarianism, the renunciation of all deistic religious practices, and so on.</p>
<p>Any association based on that 1901 law ran contrary to the meaning of the Elohim's message by definition, at least in the way we had structured it. Since all members of such an association could vote, we were not respecting the principles of geniocracy, according to which only the most intelligent people may take part in making decisions.</p>
<p>So I had to correct this fundamental mistake, not by going so far as to abolish MADECH, but rather by transforming it, pending more effective modification of its structure. This would not run contrary to the regulations of the 1901 law. In this way, MADECH would become an organization that would support the real movement that I was going to create with its most open-minded members — in effect, a congregation of MADECH guides. This new association would bring together those people who wished to open others' minds to infinity and eternity and become guides for humanity by scrupulously applying what was required in the Elohim's message. So, in a society seeking to close people's minds in every way with deistic religions, soporific education, unthinking television programs and petty political battles, I was going to try to initiate people who would go out into the world and attempt to open the minds of others. Thus MADECH would retain its importance by becoming a support organization that would be the first point of contact for those discovering the Elohim's message. It would be made up of practicing members, and the congregation of guides was going to be a movement made up of &quot;monks&quot; guiding those practicing members.</p>
<p>I knew that there were people among the MADECH members who were quite capable of managing the organization, and I received confirmation of this during the elections to the administrative council. My replacement as president, Christian, was a physicist with a promising future, and the rest of the council was made up of people who were all equally representative and competent.</p>
<p>It was also in the month of June that François, one of the most devoted MADECH members and one of the most open-minded,</p>
<p>came to see me in Clermont-Ferrand. I told him about my desire to find a country house in as secluded a place as possible, in order to rest a little and calmly write a book in which I would relate all that had happened to me prior to 13 December 1973, before anyone could invent a lot of nonsense about my past. He told me that he had a farm in an out of the way place in Périgord, and that if I liked the area, I could spend a month or two there, and even stay as long as I wished, since nobody lived there.</p>
<p>We immediately drove off to visit the place, and inspired by the peace and quiet that I found there, I decided to stay for two months.</p>
<p>After two weeks, I was enjoying it so much that I seriously considered settling there more permanently. François came back to join us at the end of July, and we started planning the move for the day after a celebration meeting at Clermont-Ferrand on the 6th of August. I still had not decided for sure because I was afraid I might fail in my mission somehow if I moved away from the place of my marvelous encounter. However, on July 31st, while my wife Marie-Paule, Francois and I were out getting some fresh air, we saw what must have been an enormous craft passing silently and with jerky movements almost over the house.</p>
<p>At times it moved with unimaginable speed, but it also stopped suddenly several times, proceeding in a zigzag pattern like this about 500 meters from where we stood. I was delighted that other people were with me to witness the event, and an indescribable feeling of happiness came over me. François told me that the hairs on his head stood on end from emotion. To me, it was an obvious sign of the Elohim's consent to my moving to that area.</p>
<p>The next morning I noticed that I had a strange mark on the bicep of one arm, close to the fold of my elbow. I did not immediately make the connection to the sighting of the day before, but later many people told me that it could only have been a mark made by the Elohim. It was a red circle about three centimeters in diameter, its circumference was five millimeters thick, and inside it were three smaller circles.</p>
<p>This mark stayed the same for the next two weeks, then the three circles in the middle merged into one, making two concentric circles. Then, after another two weeks, the two circles disappeared, leaving a white spot on my arm, which I still have. I wish to emphasize the fact that I never suffered from that mark, and that I did not feel the least itching during the entire time I had it.</p>
<p>Some open-minded scientists to whom I showed the mark speculated that it could have been made while a sample was being taken with the help of a perfected laser.</p>
<p>The reunion of August 6th finally took place as planned in the crater of Puy-de-Lassolas, near Clermont-Ferrand, and at that meeting a splendid feeling of fraternity and harmony prevailed.</p>
<p>I had decided to hold this gathering of MADECH members on this date without really knowing why, but in fact the Elohim had guided me because on the day of the meeting some members informed me that it was the thirtieth anniversary to the day of the atomic bomb explosion at Hiroshima, and that it was also a Christian holiday, the Transfiguration. Fools will say that it was a coincidence.</p>
<p>After that meeting, some MADECH members helped me to move, and I settled down to live in Périgord.</p>
<h2 id="the-message-part-two"><a class="header" href="#the-message-part-two">The Message: Part Two</a></h2>
<p>On October 7th, at around eleven o'clock at night, I felt a sudden urge to go out and look at the sky. I dressed warmly because it was rather cool and set out walking in the dark. I was going in a certain direction without being conscious of it, and suddenly felt the need to go to a spot that François had shown me during the summer — a deserted place between two brooks and surrounded by forest. It was called the Roc Plat. I reached it around midnight, half wondering what I was doing there, but following my intuition since I had been told that I could be guided telepathically.</p>
<p>The sky was magnificent, and stars were shining everywhere, for there was not a single cloud to be seen. As I stood watching the shooting stars, the whole countryside suddenly lit up, and I saw a huge ball of fire, like a spark, appear behind some bushes. I moved towards the place where the ball of fire had appeared, filled with a tremendous joy, as I was almost certain of what I was going to find.</p>
<p>The same craft that I had seen on six occasions in the month of December 1973 was there in front of me, and the same person I had met two years earlier came towards me with a smile full of kindness.</p>
<p>I noticed one difference right away. He no longer had on the spacesuit that had seemed to make a halo around his face the first time. After all the time I had spent trying to make the world understand that I was indeed telling the truth, I was wonderfully happy to see once more the person who had been responsible for turning my life upside down. I bowed before him, and he spoke.</p>
<p>'Stand up and follow me,' he said. 'We are very satisfied with you and with everything you have done for the past two years. It is now time to pass on to the next stage, since you have proven to us that we can trust you.</p>
<p>These two years were in fact just a trial. You can see that today I have no protection around my face, and that my craft appeared to you all at once and was not equipped with flashing lights. All of that was only intended to reassure you, so that I would appear in a way that corresponds to the image that you generally have of space travelers. But now that you are sufficiently evolved not to take fright, we won't use such approach techniques any more.'</p>
<p>Following him inside the craft, I noticed that its interior looked very similar to what I had found at our first meeting — walls with the same metallic appearance as the outside, no control board or instruments, no portholes, and a floor made of a translucent blue substance on which stood two armchairs. These were made of a transparent material that reminded me a little of inflatable plastic chairs, but without feeling unpleasant.</p>
<p>He invited me to sit down in one of the two chairs, settled into the other, and asked me not to move. He then pronounced a few words in an incomprehensible language, and I seemed to feel the machine rock slightly. Then all of a sudden, I felt a sensation of severe cold, as if my whole body were turning into a block of ice, or rather as if thousands of ice crystals were penetrating all the pores of my skin, right down to the marrow of my bones. It lasted a very short time, a few seconds perhaps, and I felt nothing after that.</p>
<p>Then my companion rose and said: 'You may come, we have arrived.'</p>
<p>I followed him down the small stairway. The craft stood motionless in a metallic-looking circular room about fifteen meters in diameter and ten meters high. A door opened, and my guide told me to go in and undress completely. After that, I would receive further</p>
<p>instructions. I went into a new circular room that did not have the slightest angle and must have been about four meters in diameter. I undressed, and a voice told me to go into the room that was in front of me.</p>
<p>At that moment a door opened, and I went into a room similar to the one where I had left my clothes, but it was long and a little like a corridor. Along the length of that corridor I passed under lights of different colors in turn. The voice then told me that by following the arrows painted on the floor, I would arrive in yet another room where a bath awaited me.</p>
<p>In this next room I did indeed find a sunken bathtub. The water was lukewarm, just right, and discreetly perfumed. The voice advised me to satisfy my personal needs, which I did, and then it asked me to drink the contents of a glass located on a small shelf by the metallic wall. It was a white liquid deliciously savored with almonds, and very cold. Then some soft, pajama-like clothes that felt like silk were offered to me. They were white, very close fitting, and had been laid out ready for me on another shelf. At last a final door opened, and I found my guide again. He was escorted by two people who were of similar appearance to him but with different features, and they were every bit as welcoming.</p>
<p>I rejoined them in a huge hall where I found wonder after wonder.</p>
<p>It was arranged on several levels and must have measured 100 meters in diameter. It was covered by an absolutely transparent dome, so transparent that at first sight it was not clear even that it was a dome. Thousands of stars studded the dark sky, and yet the entire hall was brightly lit with a soft, natural looking light, as if it were midday. The floor was covered with furs and shaggy carpets of astounding, enchanting colors. The most admirable works of art were everywhere, each one more beautiful than the last, and some had animated and changing colors. Elsewhere there were plants — some bright red and others blue, as beautiful as exotic fish but several meters tall.</p>
<p>Background music was playing that sounded like an organ and a musical saw, with occasional choirs and bass voices producing extraordinary vibrations.</p>
<p>This music made the flowers bend and sway in rhythm, and they changed colors with each change of musical style.</p>
<p>Every time someone spoke, the music grew softer so that we could hear each other without difficulty and without having to raise our voices. The air was perfumed with a thousand scents that also changed with the music and our positions in the room. The whole area had been designed with about ten angled corners, which were separated at different levels and each corner had a particular character. A small stream meandered through all this.</p>
<p>My guide's two companions were showing him great respect, and the next thing he said to me was: 'Follow me. We shall make ourselves comfortable, since I have many things to tell you.'</p>
<p>I followed him to a group of armchairs and sofas made of a very soft black fur, where all four of us sat down. There my guide spoke again:</p>
<p>'Today I am going to give you a second message that will complete the one that I dictated to you in December 1973. You don't have anything to take notes with, but don't worry, everything that I say to you will remain engraved in your mind, because here we have a technique that allows you to remember everything you hear.</p>
<p>First of all, we wish to congratulate you for all that you have done over the past two years, but we also wish to warn you that the rest of your mission may be more difficult. But never be discouraged in any case, because you will be rewarded for your efforts, whatever happens now.</p>
<p>To begin with, we must correct a passage in the first message we gave you that you wrongly transcribed concerning an eventual intervention on our part to destroy humanity. It must be made clear that we will not intervene. Humanity is now arriving at a turning point in its history, and its future depends only on itself. If you can control your aggressiveness towards each other and your</p>
<p>environment, then you will reach a golden age of interplanetary civilization, in which universal happiness and fulfillment will be realized. If, on the other hand, your civilization gives way to violence, then it will destroy itself, either directly or indirectly through all this.</p>
<p>No scientific or technical problem is insurmountable for human genius, as long as human genius is in control. But someone with a deficient brain can threaten worldwide peace, just as a person of genius can bring the world happiness.</p>
<p>The sooner you set up geniocracy, the sooner you will remove the possibility of a cataclysm caused by people with minds that are not very evolved. In the event of a cataclysm destroying humanity, only the people who follow you will be saved, and they will have to repopulate the devastated Earth when all the danger has been dispersed, as happened in Noah's time.'</p>
<h2 id="buddhism"><a class="header" href="#buddhism">Buddhism</a></h2>
<p>My guide continued:</p>
<p>'Buddhism explains that at the time of death, the soul of the dead person must be vigilant enough to escape numerous devils, otherwise it will be reincarnated and fall back into the cycle. On the other hand, if it manages to escape those infamous devils, it will be liberated from the cycle and attain a state of bliss through awakening.</p>
<p>In fact, this is a very good description, which applies not to the individual but to humanity as a whole. It must resist those devils, which can make it fall back into the cycle each time it is in a position to choose. Those &quot;devils&quot; are aggressiveness directed against our fellow human beings or against nature, and the &quot;state of bliss through awakening&quot; is a golden age of civilization in which science serves the people, thus producing an earthly paradise, where the blind can see and the deaf can hear by scientific means.</p>
<p>If humanity is not sufficiently wary of these devils, it will fall back into the cycle of reincarnation, where it must start all over again from a primitive state and advance progressively towards a more evolved society in a hostile world, with all the suffering which that entails.</p>
<p>That is why we can find the swastika in our symbol, as in numerous ancient writings, which signifies &quot;the cycle&quot;. It is the choice between paradise, which the peaceful use of science makes possible, and the hell of returning to the primitive stage where humanity submits to nature instead of dominating and benefiting from it.</p>
<p>In a way, this is natural selection at the cosmic level for species that are capable of leaving their planet. Only those who perfectly control their aggressiveness can reach this stage. The others self-destruct as soon as their scientific and technological levels permit them to invent weapons powerful enough to do so. That is why we never fear those who come from elsewhere to contact us. Thousands of contacts have confirmed this absolute rule in the universe — people capable of escaping their planetary system are always peaceful.</p>
<p>When a species is capable of leaving its own solar system, it means that it has overcome the &quot;progress-destruction cycle&quot; that can occur when mastery of its own aggressive tendencies is lacking. At the same time that you discover powerful energy sources allowing you to travel beyond your own solar system, you also become capable of creating offensive weapons of irreversible destructive power.</p>
<p>Your region of the terrestrial globe, France, is already on the right track in its attempt to unite Europe, and it should be the first country without an army. France would thus set an example for the entire world. Its military professionals would then lay the foundation for a peacekeeping European army, eventually transforming it into a world peace corps. Instead of being the guardians of war, the military would then be the guardians of peace, a title deserving infinitely more respect.</p>
<p>It is necessary for an important country to show the way for others to follow, and France's neighboring countries will not invade her just because she has abolished compulsory military service and is using her professional army in the service of the Europe that she is trying to construct.</p>
<p>On the contrary, this would very quickly cause other countries to follow suit and pursue the same path taken by your country. Once Europe is united militarily, creating a single European currency can unite its economy.</p>
<p>Then the same process could be applied throughout the world, adding as we have already told you in the first message, a single world language that would become compulsory in every school on Earth. If one country must show the way, then France is that country. It is by advocating a &quot;deterrent force&quot; that we accumulate the arms of our own destruction.</p>
<p>With each country wishing to deter some other country, and in practice never quite knowing which one, an unfortunate action could then threaten to transform that &quot;deterrent force&quot; into a force of intervention, which could be fatal to the whole world.</p>
<p>It is through the past that humanity views the future. This is a mistake. We should instead be critical of the past and build the present for the future, rather than build the present on the basis of the past. You must understand that barely thirty years ago, people of countries that are now advanced were still primitive. You are only just emerging. There are millions of people on Earth who are still primitive and incapable of seeing something in the sky as anything other than a &quot;divine&quot; manifestation. Moreover, you know that deistic religions are still very strong in all the economically less-developed countries.</p>
<p>You must not revere people for their age, but for their intelligence, while seeing to it that old people have a pleasant life. Our distant ancestors should not be respected, and furthermore they should be seen as an example of poor, limited, primitive people who were unable to open themselves to the universe, and who were capable of handing down only very few things of value from one generation to the next.'</p>
<h2 id="neither-god-nor-soul"><a class="header" href="#neither-god-nor-soul">Neither God nor Soul</a></h2>
<p>My guide went on to say:</p>
<p>'The more primitive a society is, the more deistic religions will flourish within it. This fact is actually cultivated by visitors from other planets, who have no other way of peacefully visiting worlds that have not yet overcome their aggressiveness.</p>
<p>If you reach the stage where you become evolved visitors on primitive worlds, you will be forced to use such a system, which is in fact very amusing and involves passing yourselves off as gods in their eyes. In fact, this is extremely easy since, for primitive people, if you come from the sky, you can only be divine. Of course, you must lay it on a bit thick to be respected and pleasantly received, which does no harm. We continue to make appearances on Earth to see if this still works and to see the reactions of public authorities, governments, and the press. We often amuse ourselves quite a lot...</p>
<p>As we have already explained to you in the first part of this message, there is no God, and obviously, no soul. After death there is nothing, unless science is used to create something. As you know, it is possible to recreate a dead organism from one of the organism's cells, which contains its physical and intellectual blueprint. We have noted that an organism loses a few grams at the moment of its death — in fact this is merely the energy that all living things have available to them, which is eliminated at that moment. As you know, energy, like matter, has weight.</p>
<p>You also know that we have discovered that there is organized, intelligent life on the level of the infinitely small, quite certainly as evolved as we are and comparable to what we are ourselves. We have been able to prove this.</p>
<p>From there, we have discovered that the stars and planets are the atoms of a gigantic being, which itself certainly contemplates other stars with curiosity. It is also highly likely that the people living on the infinitely small levels of the infinitely large person and his fellow creatures have known periods when they believed in an immaterial &quot;God&quot;.</p>
<p>You must fully understand that everything is in everything. At this moment in an atom of your arm, millions of worlds are being born and others are dying, believing or not believing in a &quot;God&quot; and a soul, and when a millennium has gone by for you, the gigantic being of whom the sun is an atom has only had the time to take one step.</p>
<p>Time is, in fact, inversely proportional to the mass, or rather to the level of the form of life. But everything in the universe is alive and in harmony with the infinitely large and the infinitely small.</p>
<p>The Earth is alive like all the planets, and for the small growth that is humanity, it is difficult to notice this because of the time lag due to the enormous difference in mass, which prevents you from perceiving its palpitations. Nor could one of our red blood cells, or better still, one of the atoms that make up our body imagine that it forms, with its peers, a living being.</p>
<p>Finally, whatever happens to each individual, the universal balance remains constant. But if we want to be happy at our level, we must live in harmony with the infinitely large, the infinitely small, and with our fellow human beings.</p>
<p>No argument aiming to support the existence of any type of god or soul can be sustained when we glimpse, however briefly, at the infinite nature of the universe. No heaven could exist in any particular place because, since the universe is infinite, it cannot have a center. Besides, as I have already explained, there cannot be any communication between an infinitely large entity and a universe of infinitely small entities, because the difference in mass is too great, thus creating a difference in the flow of equivalent time.</p>
<p>Finally, if one can imagine an immortal soul escaping from the body after death —an image that is very poetic but rather naive since it comes from the minds of primitives— one cannot imagine where it would go, given that the universe is infinite.</p>
<p>The quantity of energy that flies off at the time of death disperses in a random way, losing all identity as it blends with all the energies suspended in the surrounding air. That identity is obviously engraved only in organized matter, such as the cells of a living being that has just died. This matter is organized according to the blueprint, which the genes of the male and the female determined at conception while creating the first cell.</p>
<p>With regard to the origin of life on Earth, some people might say:</p>
<p>&quot;Your explanation doesn't change a thing, since you cannot say what there was at the very beginning.&quot;</p>
<p>This is a foolish comment, which proves that the person who makes it has no awareness of infinity, which exists in time as well as in space. There is neither a beginning nor an end to matter, since &quot;nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed,&quot; as you have already heard it said. Only the form of matter can change according to the wishes of those who have reached a scientific level, which allows them to accomplish this.</p>
<p>It is the same for the infinite levels of life. That is what the second part of our emblem represents. The Star of David, which is composed of two intertwined triangles, means &quot;as above, so below.&quot; With the swastika, which signifies that everything is cyclic, in the middle of a six-pointed star, you have our emblem, which contains all the wisdom in the world. You can also find the two symbols together in ancient writings like the <em>Bardo Thodol</em> or Tibetan <em>Book of the Dead</em>, and in many other writings as well.</p>
<p>It is evidently very difficult for a finite human brain to be conscious of infinity, which explains the need to limit the universe in time and space by belief in one or several gods that are made responsible for everything.</p>
<p>Indeed, those who cannot reach a sufficient level of human understanding towards the universe have trouble accepting the notion of infinity, which makes humanity nothing exceptional, but merely people situated at a particular time and place in the infinite universe.</p>
<p>People obviously prefer things to be well defined, well framed, limited in a way, in the image of their own minds. Those who ask themselves if it is possible that there is life on other planets are the best example of those limited minds, and we liked very much the comparison you made during one of your lectures, likening such people to frogs at the bottom of their own pond wondering whether there was life in other ponds.'</p>
<h2 id="paradise-on-earth"><a class="header" href="#paradise-on-earth">Paradise on Earth</a></h2>
<p>'You could very soon live in a genuine terrestrial paradise if only the technology that you have at your disposal today were made to serve human well-being, instead of serving violence, armies, or the personal profit of a few.</p>
<p>Science and technology can totally liberate humanity, not only from the problem of hunger in the world, but also from the obligation to work to live, since machines can quite easily look after the daily chores by themselves, thanks to automation.</p>
<p>Already, in some of your most modern factories, where it used to take several hundred people to build one car, now only a single individual is needed to oversee a computer that commands and carries out all the car building operations. In the future, even that one person will be unnecessary. Workers' unions are not happy about this because factories are in less and less need of personnel and are letting more and more workers go. This is not normal — these fantastic machines which do the work of 500 people should enable those 500 to really live, rather than enrich only one person, their boss.</p>
<p>No individual should be in the service of another, nor work for anyone for a salary. Machines can easily do all the chores and take care of all the work, enabling people to dedicate themselves to the one thing for which they were created — to think, create and blossom.</p>
<p>That is what happens on our planet. Your children must no longer be raised according to the three primitive precepts of work, family, and country. On the contrary, they should be brought up following the principles of fulfillment, freedom, and universal fraternity.</p>
<p>&quot;Work&quot; is not sacred when it is motivated only by the need to earn just enough to live a laborious life of hardship. It is even terribly degrading to sell oneself, and one's life, in order to eat, by doing jobs that simple machines could do.</p>
<p>The &quot;family&quot; has never been anything but a way for ancient as well as modern supporters of slavery to force people to work harder for an
illusory family ideal.</p>
<p>Finally, &quot;patriotism&quot; is still only a supplementary means of creating competition between people and urging them to perform their sacrosanct work with greater ardor each day.</p>
<p>What is more, those three concepts —work, family, and country— have always been supported by primitive religions. But now, you are no longer primitive people. Shake off all those dusty old principles and make the most of your life on Earth, which science can transform into paradise.</p>
<p>Do not be taken in by those who speak to you of potential enemies and allow armament factories to compel underpaid workers to produce destructive weapons that bring profits to big industrialists.</p>
<p>Do not be taken in by those who speak to you in horror of the falling birthrate, because young people understand that they need not have so many children, and that it is better to have fewer so they can be happier, as they won't be too numerous on Earth.</p>
<p>Do not be taken in by those who constantly brandish remarks under your nose, saying things like &quot;neighboring peoples are multiplying and could become a threat.&quot; They are the same people who support the stockpiling of nuclear weapons under the pretext of &quot;deterrence&quot;.</p>
<p>Finally, do not let yourself be taken in by those who tell you that military service enables you to learn how to use a gun and that &quot;it can always be useful&quot;, while they continue to pile up nuclear missiles.</p>
<p>They want to teach you violence, to teach you not to be afraid of killing a person like yourself, using the excuse that he is wearing a different uniform, and training you until it becomes a mechanical reflex after repeated practice against training targets.</p>
<p>Do not be taken in by those who tell you that you must fight for your country. No country deserves it. Do not be influenced by those who say to you: &quot;What if enemies invade our country, shouldn't we defend ourselves?&quot; Answer that non-violence is always more efficient than
violence.</p>
<p>It is not proven that those who died for France were right, no matter how hostile their aggressors were. Look at the triumph of Gandhi in India.</p>
<p>Such people will tell you that you must fight for your liberty, but they forget that the Gauls lost their war against the Romans, and that the French are no worse off for being descendants of the conquered, having benefited from the civilization of the conquerors. Live rather in fulfillment, freedom and love, instead of listening to all those narrow-minded, aggressive people.</p>
<p>The most important aid you have to help you reach a long and lasting universal peace is television, the source of a genuine planetary awareness that makes it possible to see what goes on every day all over the globe and realize that the &quot;barbarians&quot; who live on the other side of the border have all the same joys, the same sorrows and the same problems as yourselves. It also records the progress of science, the latest artistic creations, and so on.</p>
<p>Of course, it is important to ensure that this wonderful tool of diffusion and communication does not fall into the hands of people who would use it to condition masses of people by providing biased information.</p>
<p>But you really can consider television to be the nervous system of humanity, which enables each individual to be aware of the existence of others and to see how they live. It also prevents the spread of distorted ideas about others that create a fear of strangers. Long ago there was fear of the neighboring tribe, then fear of the neighboring village, of the neighboring province, and of the neighboring state.</p>
<p>There is currently a fear of the neighboring race, and if this no longer existed, there would be fear of potential aggressors coming from another planet.</p>
<p>It is necessary to reverse this attitude and be open to everything that comes from the outside, because all fear of strangers is proof of a primitive level of civilization. In this sense, television is irreplaceable and is possibly the most important development of any civilization because, in the same way as radio, it enables all those isolated cells of humanity, which people are, to be informed at all times of what the others are doing. As already indicated, it works exactly as the nervous system does in the body of a living being.'</p>
<h2 id="the-other-world"><a class="header" href="#the-other-world">The Other World</a></h2>
<p>'You are probably wondering where you are,' my guide said. 'In fact, you are now on a base located relatively close to the Earth. In the first message, you noted that we traveled seven times faster than the speed of light. That was true 25,000 years ago when we landed on Earth.</p>
<p>Since then, we have made much progress, and we now travel through space much faster. It only takes us a few moments to make the journey that used to take us almost two months in those times, and we continue to progress. If you will now follow me, we will take a little trip together.'</p>
<p>I rose and followed my three guides. We went through an airlock, and in a vast room I noticed a craft similar to the one that had brought me from Earth, but it was far larger. The exterior must have been about twelve meters in diameter, and inside it had four seats facing each other instead of just two. We sat down as before, and again I felt the same sensation of intense cold, but it lasted much  longer this time — about ten minutes. Then the craft rocked slightly, and we stepped out through the trap door exit.</p>
<p>Before me a paradisiacal landscape unfolded, and in fact I cannot find any words to describe my enchantment at seeing huge flowers, each more beautiful than the last, and animals of unimaginable appearance were walking among them. There were birds with multicolored plumage, and pink and blue squirrels with the heads of bear cubs climbing in the branches of trees that bore both enormous fruits and gigantic flowers.</p>
<p>About thirty meters from the spacecraft, a small group of Elohim was waiting for us, and behind the trees I was able to make out a group of buildings that resembled brightly colored shells harmonizing perfectly with the vegetation. The temperature was very mild, and the air was perfumed with countless scents of exotic flowers. We walked towards the top of a hill, and a marvelous panorama began to appear. Innumerable small streams wound through the lush vegetation, and far off an azure sea sparkled in the sun.</p>
<p>Reaching a clearing, I discovered with great astonishment a group of people similar to me, by which I mean people resembling those who live on Earth, not Elohim. Most of them were naked or wore robes made of multicolored silks. They bowed respectfully before my three guides, and then we all sat down.</p>
<p>Our armchairs seemed to have been carved in the rock and were covered with thick furs that always remained fresh and comfortable despite the warmth. Some people came out of a small cave located right next to us and approached us carrying trays piled high with fruits, grilled meats accompanied by the most incredible sauces, and drinks of unforgettable flavors.</p>
<p>Behind each guest two of the men who carried the trays were kneeling ready to satisfy the slightest wish of those who were eating. The latter would ask them for whatever they desired without even looking at them.</p>
<p>During the meal some marvelous music had started up, from where I could not tell, and young naked women with figures as sculptural as those of the waiters started to dance with incomparable grace on the surrounding lawn.</p>
<p>There must have been some forty guests who were similar to people from Earth in addition to my three guides. There were white, yellow and black men and women who all spoke a language I could not understand that resembled Hebrew.</p>
<p>I was sitting to the right of the Eloha whom I had met two years earlier, and to the left of the six other Elohim. Facing me sat a young bearded man, very handsome and very slim. He wore a mysterious smile and an expression filled with fraternal feeling. To his right was a man with a noble face sporting a black beard that was very thick and very long. To his left was a more corpulent man with an Asian face. He had a shaven head.</p>
<h2 id="meeting-the-ancient-prophets"><a class="header" href="#meeting-the-ancient-prophets">Meeting the Ancient Prophets</a></h2>
<p>Towards the end of the meal, my guide started to speak to me:</p>
<p>'In my first message I told you of a residence located on our planet where people from Earth can continue to live thanks to the scientific secret of eternity that is based on a single cell.</p>
<p>Among those people are Jesus, Moses, Elijah and so on. This residence is, in fact, very large, since it is an entire planet where the members of the Council of the Eternals live as well. My name is Yahweh, and I am the president of that Council of the Eternals.</p>
<p>There are currently 8,400 people from Earth living on the planet where we are at this moment. They are people who during their lives reached a sufficient level of open-mindedness towards the infinite, or who enabled humanity on Earth to progress from its primitive level through their discoveries, their writings, their ways of organizing society and their exemplary acts of fraternity, love or selflessness.</p>
<p>Alongside them live the 700 Elohim members of the Council of the Eternals. Whatever the outcome of your mission may be, you have your place reserved here among us in this veritable little paradise where everything is easy, thanks to science, and where we live happily and eternally. I can truly say eternally, for, as on Earth, we created all life here, and we are starting to understand perfectly the life of the infinitely large, that is to say, of the planets, and we can detect signs of old age in solar systems, which will enable us to leave this planet in time to create another paradise elsewhere, as soon as we grow anxious about its survival.</p>
<p>The eternals who live here, both people from Earth and Elohim, can fulfill themselves as they wish, without having to do anything but that which pleases them — scientific research, meditation, music, painting, and so on. Or they can do nothing at all if they feel like it.</p>
<p>The servants you saw carrying the dishes a little while ago, as well as the dancers, are just biological robots. They are created according to the same principle we used to create the people of Earth in a totally scientific way, but they have been limited and are absolutely submissive to us.</p>
<p>They are also incapable of acting without orders from us, and they are very specialized. They have no aspirations of their own, and no pleasure, except those that are necessary for their specialization. They grow old and die like us, but the machine that makes them can make far more than we need. They are incapable of feelings or suffering, and cannot reproduce themselves.</p>
<p>Their life span is similar to ours — that is to say about 700 years with the help of a small surgical intervention. When one of them must be destroyed due to old age, the machine that created them produces one or several others, depending on our needs. They come out of the machine ready to function and with their normal height, for they have neither growth nor childhood.</p>
<p>They only know how to do one thing: obey people from Earth and Elohim, and they are incapable of the slightest violence.</p>
<p>They can all be recognized by the small blue stone that both males and females wear between their eyes. They take care of the dirty jobs and do all the work that is uninteresting. They are produced, taken care of and destroyed underground where, in fact, all the maintenance work is done by such robots and by enormous computers that regulate all the problems of nourishment, supply of rawmaterials, energy and other things. We each have on average ten robots at our service, and as there are slightly more than 9,000 of us —Earth people and Elohim— there is a permanent total of 90,000 male and female robots.</p>
<p>Like the Elohim members of the Council of the Eternals, the eternals from Earth are not allowed to have children. They agree to have a small operation, which makes them sterile, but that sterility can easily be reversed. The purpose of this measure is to prevent undeserving beings from joining us in this marvelous world.</p>
<p>However, male and female eternals can unite freely just as they wish, and all jealousy is eliminated.</p>
<p>In addition, men who wish to have one or more companions outside the relationships of equality that exist between eternal men and women, or who do not want to live with a woman on an equal basis, may have one or more totally submissive biological robot women with the exact appearance that is desired. The same goes for women, who can have one or several totally submissive biological robot men.</p>
<p>The machine that generates the robots gives the entity that it creates the exact physical appearance and specialization desired.</p>
<p>There are several types of ideal women and men in terms of shape and physiognomy, but the height, measurements, shape of the face, and so on, can be modified as one wishes. One can even submit the picture of someone particularly admired or loved on Earth, for example, and the machine will produce an exact replica. Thus the relationships between eternals of both sexes are much more fraternal and respectful, and the unions between them are marvelously pure and high.</p>
<p>Because of the extraordinary level of open-mindedness of those admitted here, there is never any problem between them. The majority spends almost all of their time meditating, doing scientific research, making inventions and artistic compositions, and creating all sorts of things. We can live in different cities with multiple architectural styles in greatly varied sites that we can modify at will.</p>
<p>People fulfill themselves as they wish, only doing what they like to do. Some find pleasure in doing scientific experiments, others in playing music, others in creating ever more amazing animals and others in meditating or doing nothing other than making love while enjoying the numerous pleasures of this heavenly environment, drinking from the innumerable fountains and eating the juicy fruits that grow all over the place at all times. Here there is no winter; we all live in a region comparable to your equator, but as we can scientifically control the climate, it is always fine weather and not too hot. We make the rain fall during the night when and where we wish.</p>
<p>All this, and many other things, which you could not understand all at once, makes this world a true paradise. Here, everyone is free and can be so in total safety, for all deserve that liberty.</p>
<p>All things that bring pleasure are positive, as long as that pleasure is not harmful to anyone in any way. This is why all sensual pleasures are positive, for sensuality is always an opening up to the outside world, and all such opening is good. On Earth you are only just emerging from all those primitive taboos that tried to make anything to do with sex or nudity appear evil, whereas nothing could possibly be purer.</p>
<p>Nothing is more disappointing for your creators than to hear people say that nudity is something bad: nudity, the image of what we have made. As you can see, almost everyone is naked here; and those dressed in clothes wear them either because they are works of art given to them by other eternals who made them with their own hands, or for elegance and decoration.</p>
<p>When people from Earth are admitted to this world of the eternals, they start out by receiving some chemical education so that nothing surprises them, and they have a good understanding of where they are and why.'</p>
<p>My guide, Yahweh, paused for a moment, and then said: 'You are now sitting directly opposite the man who, 2,000 years ago, was given the responsibility of creating a movement to spread more widely the message we had left originally to the people of Israel — a message which would enable you to be understood now. I am referring to Jesus, whom we were able to recreate from a cell that we had preserved before his crucifixion.'</p>
<p>The handsome, bearded young man seated opposite offered me a smile full of fraternity.</p>
<p>'To his right is Moses, on his left Elijah, and to the left of Jesus sits the one remembered on Earth by the name of Buddha. A little further on you can see Mohammed, in whose writings I am called Allah, because out of respect they did not dare call me by name. The forty men and women present at this meal are all representatives of the religions created after our contacts on Earth.'</p>
<p>All those present looked at me with expressions that were very friendly and amused, probably because they were remembering their own surprise upon arriving in this world.</p>
<p>My guide continued: 'Now I will show you some of our installations.'</p>
<p>He stood up, and I followed him. He invited me to put on a very wide belt bearing a huge buckle. He and his two friends had buckled on the same kind of adornment. Immediately I felt myself being lifted up from the ground and carried at about twenty meters above the grass, almost level with the tops of the trees, at a very great speed, maybe a hundred kilometers per hour, maybe more, towards a precise location. My three companions were with me, Yahweh in front and his two friends behind.</p>
<p>One curious thing, among others, was that I did not feel any wind at all whipping against my face.</p>
<p>We landed in a small clearing, quite close to the entrance of a small cave. We were in fact still being carried by our belts, but only at a height of one meter above the ground, and moving more slowly. We passed through galleries with metallic walls and arrived in a vast hall, in the center of which was an enormous machine surrounded by about ten robots recognizable by the ornaments on their foreheads. There, we landed on the ground again and took off our belts.</p>
<p>Yahweh then spoke: 'Here is the machine that makes biological robots. We are going to create one of them for you.'</p>
<p>He made a sign to one of the robots located near the machine, and the robot touched certain parts of it. Then he made a sign for me to move close to a window measuring about two meters by one meter. </p>
<p>In a bluish liquid I then saw the form of a human skeleton vaguely taking shape. Its form grew clearer and clearer, finally becoming a real skeleton. Then some nerves took shape and formed over the bones, then some muscles and finally some skin and hair. A splendid athlete was now lying there in a position where moments earlier there had been nothing.</p>
<p>Yahweh spoke again: 'Remember in the Old Testament, this description in <em>Ezekiel</em>, Chapter 37:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Son of man, can these bones live?...there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone. And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above...and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The description that you will give of this will certainly be similar to Ezekiel's — apart from the noise, which we have been able to eliminate.'</p>
<p>Indeed, what I had seen corresponded perfectly to Ezekiel's description. Following this, the prostrate figure had slid to the left and disappeared completely from my sight. Then a trap door opened, and I saw the creature whose rapid creation I had witnessed, lying on a very white fabric.</p>
<p>He was still immobile, but suddenly he opened his eyes, got up, came down the few steps that separated him from our level, and after exchanging a few words with another robot, came up to me. He gave me his hand, which I shook, and I felt his skin soft and warm.</p>
<p>'Do you have a picture of a loved one with you?' Yahweh asked.</p>
<p>'Yes,' I answered, 'I have a picture of my mother in my wallet, which I left in my clothes.'</p>
<p>He showed it to me, asking if it was the right one. When I agreed that it was, he gave it to one of the robots, who inserted it in the machine and touched parts of it. Through the window I witnessed yet another creation of a living being. Then, as the skin started to cover the flesh, I realized what was happening: they were making an exact replica of my mother from the picture I had provided. Indeed, a few moments later, I was able to kiss my mother, or rather the image of my mother as she had been ten years before, for the picture I had provided had been taken about ten years previously.</p>
<p>Yahweh then said to me: 'Now allow us to make a very small puncture in your forehead.'</p>
<p>One of the robots came towards me, and with the help of a small device similar to a syringe, pricked my forehead so lightly that I hardly felt it.</p>
<p>Then he inserted the syringe in the enormous machine and touched other parts of it. Again an entity was formed before my eyes.</p>
<p>As the skin covered the flesh, I saw another 'me' take shape, little by little. Indeed, the being that emerged from the machine was an exact replica of myself.</p>
<p>'As you can see,' Yahweh told me, 'this other you is not wearing the small stone on his forehead, which is characteristic of the robots and that the replica of your mother also had.</p>
<p>From a photo we can only make a replica of the physical body, with no psychological personality or almost none, whereas from a sample cell like the one we took from between your eyes, we can create a total replication of the individual whose cell we took, complete with the memory, personality and character. We could now send the other you back to Earth, and people would not notice a thing. But we are going to destroy this replica immediately, for it is of no use to us.</p>
<p>At this moment there are two of you who are listening to me, and the personalities of these two beings are beginning to be different, because you know that you are going to live, and he knows that he is going to be destroyed. But that does not bother him, since he knows he is nothing but yourself. This is more proof, if proof is needed, of the non-existence of the soul - or a purely spiritual entity unique to each body- in which certain primitive people believe.'</p>
<p>After that we left the room that housed that enormous machine, and through a corridor we entered another room containing other equipment.</p>
<p>We approached another machine.</p>
<p>'In this machine are kept the cells of malevolent people who will be recreated to be judged when the time comes. They are cells from those on Earth who preached violence, wickedness, aggressiveness and obscurantism. Despite having in their possession all the elements to understand where they came from, these people did not have the sense to recognize the truth. They will be recreated to undergo the punishment they deserve, after being judged by those whom they made to suffer or by their ancestors or descendants.</p>
<p>You now fully deserve a rest. This robot will be your guide and will provide you with anything you desire until tomorrow morning. We will then have a few more words to say to you, and afterwards we will accompany you back to Earth. Between now and then you will have a foretaste of what awaits you when your mission is completed on your planet.'</p>
<p>The next moment a robot approached and saluted me respectfully.</p>
<p>He was tall, athletic looking, dark, beardless and very handsome.</p>
<h2 id="a-foretaste-of-paradise"><a class="header" href="#a-foretaste-of-paradise">A Foretaste of Paradise</a></h2>
<p>The robot asked me if I wanted to see my room, and after I agreed, he handed me one of the belts used for travelling. I found myself being transported above the ground again, and when I landed once more, I found myself in front of a house that looked more like a scallop shell than a residence. The interior was entirely carpeted with shaggy furs, and there was a huge bed, at least as big as four Earth beds, looking as if it had been sunk into the ground. It was recognizable only by the different colored furs covering it. In one corner of the huge room, there was a massive sunken bathtub as big as a swimming pool, surrounded by vegetation of marvelous shapes and colors.</p>
<p>'Would you like some female companions?' asked the robot.</p>
<p>'Come, you can make your own choice.'</p>
<p>I put my belt on again and found myself transported back in front of the machine used for making robots. A luminous cube appeared in front of me.</p>
<p>I was shown to an armchair facing the cube and given a helmet.</p>
<p>When I had settled down, a magnificent young brunette with</p>
<p>marvelously harmonious proportions appeared three-dimensionally within the luminous cube. She moved in such a way as to show herself off, and had she not been in a cube floating one meter above the ground, I would have thought she was real.</p>
<p>My robot asked me whether she pleased me and if I wished to have her shape altered or her face modified. I told him that I considered her perfect.</p>
<p>He replied that aesthetically speaking, she was the ideal woman, or rather, one of the three types of ideal women, as defined by the computer according to the taste of the majority of residents on the planet. But I could ask for any modification that I desired.</p>
<p>At my refusal to change anything whatsoever about that magnificent creature, a second woman, this time blonde and alluring, appeared in the luminous cube. She was different but just as perfect as the first one. With her I could not find anything to alter either.</p>
<p>Finally, a third young female, this one a redhead more sensual than the first two, appeared in the strange cube. The robot asked me if I cared to see other models, or if these three ideal types of my race would be enough for me. I answered quite naturally that I thought these three people were extraordinary.</p>
<p>At that moment, a magnificent black woman appeared in the cube, then a very fine slender Chinese female, and then finally another voluptuous young Asian woman.</p>
<p>The robot asked me which person I desired to have as a companion. Since I answered that they all pleased me, he went towards the robot making machine and spoke for a moment with one of his peers. Then the machine was set in motion, and I understood what was about to happen.</p>
<p>A few minutes later I was back at my residence with my six companions. There I had the most unforgettable bath that I have ever had, in the company of those charming robots, totally submissive to all my desires.</p>
<p>Afterwards my robot guide asked if I wished to make some music.</p>
<p>When I said 'yes', he took out a helmet similar to the one I had put on before the projection of the female robot models.</p>
<p>'Now,' he said, 'imagine some music that you would like to hear.'</p>
<p>Immediately a sound was heard, corresponding exactly to music that I had been thinking about, and as I constructed a melody in my head, that same melody became a reality with sounds of an amplitude and a sensitivity that were more extraordinary than any I had ever heard. The dream of every composer had become a reality — the ability to compose music directly without having to go through the laborious process of writing and orchestrating.</p>
<p>Then my six adorable companions began dancing to my music in a most voluptuous and bewitching way.</p>
<p>After a while, my robot asked me if I would also care to compose some images. Another helmet was given to me, and I sat in front of a semi-circular screen. I set myself to imagining certain scenes, and these scenes at once became visible on the screen. I was seeing, in fact, an immediate visualization of all the thoughts that came to me. I started thinking about my grandmother, and she appeared on the screen. I thought of a bouquet of flowers, and it appeared; and when I imagined a rose with green spots, it appeared as well. This machine actually made it possible to visualize one's thoughts instantaneously, without having to explain them. What a marvel!</p>
<p>'With training one can create a story and have it played out,' my robot told me. 'Many performances of this kind, performances of direct creation, are held here.'</p>
<p>Finally, after a while, I went to bed and spent the most extravagant night of my life with my marvelous female companions.</p>
<p>The next day, I got up, took another perfumed bath, and then a robot served us a delicious breakfast. Then he asked me to follow him, for Yahweh was expecting me. I put on the transportation belt again, and soon found myself in front of a strange machine, where the president of the Council of the Eternals was waiting for me.</p>
<p>It was not as large as the one that created robots but was still very big. A sizable armchair was embedded in its center.</p>
<p>Yahweh asked me if I had spent a pleasant night, and then explained to me: 'This machine will awaken certain faculties that lie dormant within you. Your brain will then be able to exploit its full potential. Sit down here.'</p>
<p>I sat down in the chair that he indicated, and a sort of shell covered my skull. I thought I was losing consciousness for a moment, and then it felt as if my head were about to explode.</p>
<p>I saw multicolored flashes pass before my eyes. Finally, everything stopped, and a robot helped me out of the armchair. I felt terribly different.</p>
<p>I had the impression that everything was simple and easy.</p>
<p>Yahweh spoke again: 'From now on, we will see through your eyes, hear through your ears, and speak through your mouth. We will even be able to heal through your hands, as we already do at Lourdes and in many other places in the world, for some sick people who deserve our help because of their will to radiate the message we have given you, and because of their efforts to acquire a cosmic mind by opening themselves to infinity.</p>
<p>We observe everyone. Huge computers ensure a constant surveillance of all people living on Earth. A mark is attributed to everyone depending on whether their actions during their life led towards love and truth or towards hate and obscurantism.</p>
<p>When the time comes to evaluate, those who went in the right direction will have the right to eternity on this heavenly planet, those who achieved nothing positive yet were not evil will not be recreated, and for those whose actions were particularly negative, a cell from their body will have been preserved, which will allow us to recreate them when the time comes, so that they can be judged and suffer the punishment they deserve.</p>
<p>You who are reading this message, understand clearly that you can have access to this marvelous world, this paradise. You will be welcomed, you who follow our messenger, Claude Rael, our ambassador on the path to universal love and cosmic harmony, you who will help him realize what we will ask of him — for we see through his eyes, hear through his ears, and speak through his mouth.</p>
<p>Your idea of creating a congregation of guides for humanity is very good. But be strict with regard to their selection, so that our message will never be deformed or betrayed.</p>
<p>Meditation is indispensable for opening one's mind, but asceticism is useless. You must enjoy life with all the strength of your senses, for the awakening of the senses goes together with the awakening of the mind.</p>
<p>Continue to play sports if you wish and if you have the time, for all sports and games are good whether they develop musculature, or better still, self-control as do motor racing and motorbike racing. </p>
<p>A person who feels alone can always try to communicate</p>
<p>telepathically with us, while trying to be in harmony with the infinite; he or she will feel an immense sense of well being. What you have advised concerning a gathering of people who believe in us in each region on Sunday mornings at about eleven o'clock is very good.</p>
<p>Few members are presently doing this.</p>
<p>Mediums are useful, so seek them out. But balance them because their gifts as mediums —which are only gifts of telepathy— unbalance them, and they begin to believe in magic, the supernatural, and other incredibly stupid things, including an ethereal body, which is a new way of trying to believe in the soul which does not exist. In fact, what they are actually doing is tuning into people who lived several centuries ago, and whom we have recreated on this paradisiacal planet.</p>
<p>There is an important revelation, which you may now make. The Jews are our direct descendants on Earth. That is why a specific destiny is reserved for them. They are the descendants of &quot;the sons of Elohim and the daughters of men&quot;, as mentioned in <em>Genesis</em>.</p>
<p>Their original mistake was to have mated with their scientific creations. That is why they have suffered for such a long time.</p>
<p>But for them the time of forgiveness has come, and they will now be able to live peacefully in their recovered country, unless they make another mistake in not recognizing you as our messenger. We wish our embassy on Earth to be built in Israel on a tract of land given to you by the government. If they refuse, you may build it elsewhere, and Israel will undergo a new punishment for not having recognized our messenger.</p>
<p>You must devote yourself entirely to your mission. Do not worry, you will be able to support your family. People who believe in you and therefore in us must help you. You are our messenger, our ambassador, our prophet, and in any case you have your place reserved here among all the other prophets.</p>
<p>You are the one who must gather together people of all religions.</p>
<p>For the movement you have created, the Raelian Movement, must be the religion of religions. I insist that it is indeed a religion, although an atheistic religion, as you have already understood.</p>
<p>Those who help you we shall not forget, and those who cause you trouble we shall not forget either. Do not be afraid and fear no one, for whatever happens you have your place among us. As for those who lose confidence, shake them up a little.</p>
<p>Two thousand years ago, those who believed in our messenger, Jesus, were thrown into a lion's den. Today, what do you risk? The irony of fools? The sneers of those who haven't understood anything and prefer to keep to their primitive beliefs? What is all that compared to a lion's den? What is all that compared with what awaits those who follow you? Truly it is easier than ever to follow one's intuition.</p>
<p>In the Koran, Mohammed, who is among us, has already said on the subject of prophets:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The moment for men to give account is drawing near; and yet in their nonchalance they are turning away (from their creator).</p>
<p>No new warning comes from their creator whom they ignore and laugh at. And their hearts are amused by it.</p>
<p>Those who do evil comfort themselves secretly by saying:</p>
<p>Is not this man only a mortal as we are?</p>
<p>It is a jumble of dreams. He made it all up himself. He is a poet.</p>
<p>But let him bring a miracle like those who were sent in time past.</p>
<p><em>— Koran, Sura 21: 1-5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Already Mohammed had to suffer the sarcasm of some, and Jesus had to suffer it as well. When he was on the cross, some said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If thou be the Son of Elohim, come down from the cross..</p>
<p><em>— Matthew 27: 40.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And yet, as you have seen, Jesus is in marvelous shape and will be for all eternity, as is Mohammed and all those who followed them and believed in them. On the other hand, those who criticized them will be recreated in order to receive their punishment.</p>
<p>The computers that monitor those people who have no knowledge of this message are linked to a system that, at the time of death and from a distance, automatically samples a cell from which they may be recreated if they deserve it.</p>
<p>While waiting to build our embassy, create a seminary for the Guides of the Raelian Movement near the area where you reside. It is there that you who are our prophet, the Guide of Guides, will be able to train those responsible for spreading our message all over the Earth.'</p>
<h2 id="the-new-commandments"><a class="header" href="#the-new-commandments">The New Commandments</a></h2>
<p>Yahweh then said:</p>
<p>'Those who wish to follow you will apply the laws I am now about to give you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You will appear at least once in your lifetime before the Guide of Guides so that he may transmit your cellular plan through  manual contact, or have it transmitted by an initiated Guide, to the computer that will take this into account at your life's assessment hour of judgment.</p>
<p>You will think at least once a day of the Elohim, your Creators.</p>
<p>You will try to radiate the message of the Elohim around you by every possible means.</p>
<p>You will, at least once a year, give a donation to the Guide of Guides that is equal to at least one percent of your annual income, in order to help him devote himself full time to his mission and travel around the world to spread this message.</p>
<p>You will, at least once a year, invite the Guide of your region into your home, and you will gather at your place people who are interested in hearing him explain the message in all its dimensions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the Guide of Guides should disappear, the new Guide of Guides will be the one who has been designated by the former Guide of Guides. The Guide of Guides will be the guardian of the embassy of the Elohim on Earth and will be able to live there with his family and with the people of his choice.</p>
<p>You, Claude Rael, you are our ambassador on Earth, and the people who believe in you must provide you with the means to accomplish your mission.</p>
<p>You are the last of the prophets before the Judgement; you are the prophet of the religion of religions, the demystifier and the shepherd of shepherds. You are the one whose coming was announced in all the religions by the ancient prophets, our representatives.</p>
<p>You are the one who will bring back the shepherds' flock before the water is spilled, the one who will bring back to their creators those they have created. Those who have ears may hear, those who have eyes may see. All those who have their eyes open will see that you are the first prophet who can be understood only by scientifically evolved beings. All that you speak of is incomprehensible to primitive peoples.</p>
<p>This is a sign that will be noticed by those whose eyes are open — the sign of the Revelation, the Apocalypse.'</p>
<h2 id="to-the-people-of-israel"><a class="header" href="#to-the-people-of-israel">To the People of Israel</a></h2>
<p>'The State of Israel must give some territory located near Jerusalem to the Guide of Guides so that he may build there the residence, the embassy of the Elohim. The time has come, people of Israel, to build the New Jerusalem as it was foreseen. Claude Rael is the one who was foretold. Reread your writings and open your eyes.</p>
<p>We wish to have our embassy among our descendants, and the people of Israel are the descendants of the children born of the unions between the sons of Elohim and the daughters of men.</p>
<p>People of Israel, we removed you from the clutches of the Egyptians, and you did not show yourselves worthy of our confidence; we entrusted you with a message destined for all humanity, and you jealously kept it instead of spreading it abroad.</p>
<p>You have suffered for a long time to pay for your errors, but the time of forgiveness has come, and as was foreseen, we have said: &quot;To the North give them up and to the South do not hold them back.&quot; I have gathered your sons and daughters &quot;from the ends of the Earth,&quot; as was written in <em>Isaiah</em>, and you have been able to find your country again. You will be able to live there in peace if you listen to the last of the prophets, the one who was foretold to you, and if you help him to accomplish what we ask of him.</p>
<p>This is your last chance, otherwise another country will welcome the Guide of Guides and build our embassy on its territory, and that country will be close to yours; it will be protected and happiness shall prevail, and the State of Israel will be destroyed once more.</p>
<p>You, child of Israel who has not yet returned to your ancestral lands, wait before returning there to see if the government will agree to our embassy being built there. If they refuse, do not return, and you will be one of those who will be saved from the destruction and whose descendants will one day be able to find the promised land again, when the time comes.</p>
<p>People of Israel, recognize the one foretold to you, give him the territory to build our embassy, and help him build it. Otherwise, as happened 2,000 years ago, it will be constructed elsewhere, and if it is constructed elsewhere, you will be dispersed once again. If, 2,000 years ago, you had recognized that Jesus was indeed our messenger, all the Christians in the world would not be Christians, but Jews. You would not have had problems, and you would have remained our ambassadors. But instead this task was given to other people who took Rome for their base.</p>
<p>Two thousand years ago, you did not recognize our messenger, and it was not Jerusalem but Rome that shone. Now you have a new chance for it to be Jerusalem once more. If you do not seize it, another country will shelter our embassy, and you will no longer have any right to the land we had chosen for you.</p>
<p>There, I have finished. You will be able to annotate all this by yourself once you have returned to Earth. Now enjoy this paradise a while longer, and we will take you back for you to complete your mission before returning to us for good.'</p>
<p>I remained there for several more hours, enjoying the many pleasures of that world, meandering amongst numerous fountains and enjoying the company of the great prophets whom I had met the day before during meditation sessions. Then, after a last meal taken with the same people as the day before, I found myself once again in the large vessel, which set me down at the observation station. From there I retraced my route of the day before, and found myself with my clothes in the small craft, which dropped me off where it had picked me up, at Roc Plat. I looked at my watch — it was midnight.</p>
<p>I returned home, where I immediately set to work to write down all that I had been told. Everything was perfectly clear in my mind, and I was surprised to find that I was writing it all at one stroke, recalling without any hesitation the sentences I had heard. The words remained as if engraved in my mind just as I had been told they would at the beginning.</p>
<p>When I finished the account of what had happened, I began to feel very clearly that something had been released inside me. This had never happened before. I began writing again, all the while observing closely what I was putting down as if I was simultaneously</p>
<p>discovering it as a reader. I was writing, but this time I did not feel like the author of what was appearing on the paper. The Elohim were starting to speak through my mouth, or rather, to write with my hand.</p>
<p>What was being written before my eyes dealt with all areas that a person is confronted with during his or her lifetime, and the right way to react when faced with these problems. It was, in fact, a code of life — a new way of behaving in the face of life's events, of behaving like a man, that is to say, as an evolved being, and therefore trying in every way to open one's mind to infinity and to place oneself in harmony with it.</p>
<p>These great rules dictated by the Elohim, our creators, &quot;Our Fathers who are in Heaven&quot;, as our ancestors used to say without really understanding, are all set forth here in the following pages in their entirety.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="3"><a class="header" href="#3">3</a></h1>
<hr />
<h1 id="the-keys"><a class="header" href="#the-keys">THE KEYS</a></h1>
<h2 id="introduction-1"><a class="header" href="#introduction-1">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>For thousands of years those opposed to enlightenment and reform have effectively imprisoned our minds in straitjackets. These writings, however, are the keys we can use to set ourselves free.</p>
<p>The door that seals the human mind is fastened by many locks, all of which must be opened at the same time if one wants to be able to free it towards the infinite. If only one key is used, the other locks will remain fastened, and if they are not all kept open at the same time, then while the second lock is being freed, the first one will close again, preventing the door from opening.</p>
<p>Human society is afraid of what it does not know, and so it is afraid of what lies behind this door — even if it is happiness gained through knowledge of the truth. Therefore, it applies pressure to prevent people from even partly opening this door because society itself prefers to remain in a state of misfortune and ignorance.</p>
<p>This is yet another obstacle found on the threshold of the doorway through which the mind must pass to free itself. But, as Gandhi said:</p>
<p>'It is not because no one sees the truth that it becomes an error.' So if you attempt to open this door, ignore the sarcasm of those who have not seen anything — and of those who having seen, pretend not to see, because of their fear of the unknown.</p>
<p>Also if opening the door seems too difficult for you, ask for help from a Guide, since Guides have already opened the doors of their own minds and know the difficulties involved. They will not be able to open your door for you, but they will be able to explain the different techniques that will enable you to succeed. Besides, they are living witnesses of the happiness that can be achieved by opening the door, and they prove wrong those who are afraid of what lies behind the door.</p>
<h2 id="humanity"><a class="header" href="#humanity">Humanity</a></h2>
<p>In every situation, we must always consider things in regard to four levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In relation to infinity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In relation to the Elohim, our parents and creators;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In relation to human society;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And finally, in relation to the individual.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The most important level is that relating to infinity, for it is in relation to this level that all things must be judged — but always with one constant factor: love. This means taking others into account, who must be given love, because we must live in harmony with infinity, and to do this we must live in harmony with others, because they are a part of infinity as well.</p>
<p>Then we must take into account the advice given by our creators, the Elohim, and act in such a way that human society listens to the advice of those who created it.</p>
<p>Then we must take into account society, which makes it possible for individuals to blossom on the path of truth. But although society must be taken into account, it should not be followed; on the contrary, society must be helped to emerge from its primitive straitjacket by regular questioning of all its habits and traditions, even if these are supported by laws that are only there to try and imprison our minds in shackles of obscurantism.</p>
<p>Finally, we must take into account the fulfillment of the individual.</p>
<p>Without this the mind does not reach its full potential, and it is impossible to harmonize yourself with infinity and become a new man if you are not fulfilled.</p>
<h3 id="birth"><a class="header" href="#birth">Birth</a></h3>
<p>You must never impose any religion whatsoever on a child, who is still but a larva, unable to understand what is happening to itself. So you must neither baptize nor circumcise children, nor submit them to any action that they have not themselves accepted. You must wait for them to reach the age when they can understand and choose, and if a religion appeals to them at that time, then leave them free to adhere to it.</p>
<p>A birth should be a festive occasion, for the Elohim created us in their image to be capable of reproducing ourselves. By creating a living being, we preserve our own species and respect the work of our creators.</p>
<p>A birth should also be an act of love, achieved in harmony as far as sounds, colors and temperature are concerned, so that the human being who is emerging into life develops the habit of being in harmony.</p>
<p>You must immediately develop in children the habit of respecting the liberty of others, and when they cry at night, go to them discreetly but without their realizing that crying has brought them the comfort of being tended. On the contrary, you must go to them and look after them when they make no sound, and not go to them —at least not with their being aware of it— when they cry. That way they will get used to everything going better when they are in harmony with their surrounding. &quot;God helps those who help themselves&quot;.</p>
<p>In fact, parents must understand that as soon as a child is born, it is first of all an individual, and that no individual should be treated like a child.</p>
<p>Even our creators do not treat us like children, but as individuals.</p>
<p>That is why they do not intervene directly to help us solve our problems but allow us to overcome the obstacles that we encounter by working things out for ourselves as responsible individuals.</p>
<h2 id="education"><a class="header" href="#education">Education</a></h2>
<p>The little creature who is still just the larva of a human being must, in its infancy, grow accustomed to respecting the liberty and the tranquillity of others. Since little children are too young to understand and reason, corporal punishment28 should be rigorously applied by the person bringing them up, so that they suffer when they cause suffering or disturb others by showing a lack of respect.</p>
<p>This corporal punishment28 should be applied only to very young children, and then, in keeping with the child's growing power to reason and understand, it should be phased out progressively and eventually stopped altogether. From the age of seven, corporal punishment28 should be quite exceptional, and from the age of fourteen, it should never be applied.</p>
<p>You will use corporal punishment28 only when punishing a child for not respecting the freedom and tranquillity of others or yourself.</p>
<p>You will teach your child to blossom, and you will teach him or her always to have a questioning attitude towards those things which society and its schools want to inculcate. You will not force your child to learn things that are not useful, and you will let him or her follow any desired path because, do not forget, the most important thing is his or her fulfillment.</p>
<p>You will teach your child always to judge things in the right order with respect to infinity, with respect to our creators, with respect to society, and with respect to itself.</p>
<p>You will not impose any religion on your child, but instead impartially teach him or her the various beliefs that exist throughout the world — or at least the most important ones in chronological order: the Jewish religion, the Christian religion and the Muslim religion. You will try to learn the major trends of thought of the eastern religions, if you can, so that you are able to explain them to your child. Finally, you will explain to him or her the main points of the message given by the Elohim to the last of the prophets.</p>
<p>Above all, you will teach your child to love the world in which it lives, and through this world, our creators.</p>
<p>You will teach him or her to open up to infinity and try to live in harmony with infinity.</p>
<p>You will teach your child about the marvelous work accomplished by the Elohim, our creators, and constantly seek ways for humanity to become capable of repeating, some day, what our creators have done — namely creating other humanities elsewhere by scientific means.</p>
<p>You will teach your child to consider itself a part of the infinite — that is, both immense and minute at the same time. &quot;From dust were ye made, and dust ye shall become.&quot;</p>
<p>You will teach your child that the wrong done to others cannot be repaired by any confession or absolution once it is done, and that it must not be thought that when death is near, it is sufficient to begin to believe in the Elohim or any god in order to have the right to eternal life.</p>
<p>You will teach your child that we are judged by what we do throughout our lives, that the path which leads to wisdom is long, and that it certainly takes a whole lifetime to master it sufficiently. A person who has not gone in the right direction throughout life will not gain the right to scientific resurrection on the planet of the eternals just by making a sudden late change to the right path — that is, unless that person's regret is truly genuine, and he or she acts with great sincerity, making up for lost time, striving to be forgiven by
those who were harmed, and devoting all his or her means to bringing them love and happiness.</p>
<p>All this will still not be enough for the person who has made others suffer, for even if he or she is forgiven by them and gives them love, the errors will have been erased, but nothing positive will have been accomplished.</p>
<p>This person will then have to set out anew, bring happiness to new people whom he or she has never harmed and help those who spread the truth, the guides.</p>
<p>But it is too late for someone who has regrets only at the moment of death or shortly before. This person will not be forgiven.</p>
<h2 id="sensual-education"><a class="header" href="#sensual-education">Sensual Education</a></h2>
<p>Sensual education is one of the most important things, and yet at the moment, it scarcely exists at all.</p>
<p>You will awaken the mind of your child, but you will also awaken his or her body, for the awakening of the body is linked to the awakening of the mind. All those who seek to numb the body are also numbing the mind.</p>
<p>Our creators have given us our senses so that we use them. The nose is meant for smelling, the eyes for seeing, the ears for hearing, the mouth for tasting, and the fingers for touching. We must develop our senses so as to get more enjoyment from all the things around us, which our creators put here for us to enjoy.</p>
<p>A sensual individual is far more likely to be in harmony with infinity, because such a person can feel it without having to meditate or reflect.</p>
<p>Meditation and reflection will enable that individual to understand this harmony better and to radiate it all around himself or herself by
teaching it. To be sensual means to let your environment give you pleasure.</p>
<p>Sexual education is very important as well, but it only teaches the technical functions and uses of the organs. Sensual education, on the other hand, teaches us how to gain pleasure from our organs purely for pleasure's sake, without necessarily seeking to use them for their utilitarian purposes.</p>
<p>To say nothing to your children about their sexual organs is wrong, and although it is better to explain what they are for, this is still not enough.</p>
<p>You must explain how they can gain pleasure from them.</p>
<p>To explain only their function would be like telling them that music is for marching to, that knowing how to write is helpful only for penning letters of complaint, or that movies are useful only for giving audio visual courses, and other such nonsense. Fortunately, thanks to artists and through the awakening of our senses, we can obtain pleasure from listening, reading or looking at works of art that were made for no other reason than to give pleasure. The same goes for the sexual organs. They are not just for satisfying our natural needs or for ensuring reproduction, but also for giving pleasure to others and ourselves. Thanks to science, we have finally emerged from the days when showing one's body was a &quot;sin&quot;, and when sexual intercourse brought its own punishment — the conception of a child.</p>
<p>Now thanks to contraceptive techniques, sexual union is freely possible without it becoming a definitive commitment — or even a possible one. You will teach your child all this without shame, but on the contrary, with love, clearly explaining that he or she was made to be happy and blossom fully — that is to say, to enjoy life with all the senses and with their full force.</p>
<p>You must never be ashamed of your body or of your nakedness, for nothing displeases our creators more than to see those they created feeling ashamed of the appearance that has been given to them.</p>
<p>You will teach your children to love their bodies and every part of the Elohim's creation, because in loving their creation, we love them as well.</p>
<p>Each one of our organs was created by our parents, the Elohim, so that we might use it feeling not shame, but happiness at using something for which it was designed. If the act of using one of our organs brings pleasure, it means that our creators wish us to have that pleasure.</p>
<p>Every individual is a garden that should not be left uncultivated. A life without pleasure is an uncultivated garden. Pleasure is the fertilizer that opens up the mind. Asceticism is useless unless it is a temporary ordeal designed to train the mind to dominate the body.</p>
<p>But once we have succeeded in the ordeal that we have set ourselves —which must always be limited in time— we should once more enjoy the pleasures of life.</p>
<p>Asceticism can be accepted as the fallow period of that garden which is an individual — that is to say, a momentary pause in the search for pleasure, which enables us to appreciate it better later on.</p>
<p>You will accustom your children to having more and more freedom by always treating them as individuals. You will respect their tastes and inclinations, as you would like them to respect your own. Make sure you realize that your child, male or female, is what it is, and that you will not be able to make it what you want, just as it will not be able to make you what it wants you to be. Respect your child so that it respects you, and respect its tastes so that it respects yours.</p>
<h2 id="fulfillment"><a class="header" href="#fulfillment">Fulfillment</a></h2>
<p>Self-fulfillment should be sought according to one's tastes and aspirations, without any preoccupation with what others think, as long as no one else is being hurt.</p>
<p>If you feel like doing something, first see that it does no harm to anyone, then do it without worrying about what others think of it. If you feel like having a sensual or sexual experience with one or several other individuals, whatever sex they may be, you may behave as you desire, as long as they agree. Everything is permitted on the path to
fulfillment in order to awaken the body, and hence the mind.</p>
<p>We are at last emerging from those primitive times when women were seen merely as instruments of reproduction belonging to society.</p>
<p>Thanks to science, women are now free to fulfill themselves sensually, without having to fear the punishment of pregnancy. At last, woman is truly the equal of man, since she may enjoy her body without living in fear of having to endure alone the undesired consequences of her acts.</p>
<p>Conceiving a child is something too important to be left to chance.</p>
<p>Therefore, do so only by choice after mature consideration in a marvelous act of love, being fully aware of what you are doing, and being certain that you truly wish it, because a child cannot become a successful individual unless it is truly desired at the very moment of
conception.</p>
<p>The moment of conception is the most important because it is at that time that the first cell, and therefore the plan of the individual, is conceived.</p>
<p>This moment must therefore be desired, so that the first cell may be created in perfect harmony, with the minds of the two parents thinking strongly and consciously of the human being that they are conceiving. This is one of the secrets of the new individual.</p>
<p>If you are looking only for the fulfillment of your body, and therefore of your mind, use the means that science has put at your disposal, starting with contraception. Only conceive a child when you yourself are fulfilled, so that the life you conceive may be the fruit of the union of two fulfilled individuals.</p>
<p>To reach fulfillment, use the means that science has provided to enable you to awaken your body to pleasure without any risks.</p>
<p>Pleasure and procreation are two different things that must not be confused. The first is for the individual, and the second is for the species. It is only when the individual is fulfilled that he or she can create a fulfilled human being.</p>
<p>If by accident you have conceived a child without desiring it, use the means that science puts at your disposal — abortion. A child who was not desired at the moment of conception cannot blossom fully, since it was not created in harmony. Do not listen to those who try to frighten you by talking about the physical —and especially moral— consequences that an abortion can trigger. There are none if you are treated by competent people. It's rather by keeping an undesired child, that you will be left with physical and moral disturbances that can be passed on, and that will make the child you brought into the world suffer too.</p>
<p>Having a child does not necessarily imply that you must be married or even live with a man. Already, many women have decided to
have one or more children without marrying or living with a man.</p>
<p>The education of a child, who is an individual right from birth, should not necessarily be provided by the parents. It would indeed often be preferable for education to be entrusted to specialized people who would contribute far more than some parents towards their children's
fulfillment.</p>
<p>If you wish to have a child without living with a man, do as you desire. Fulfill yourself, as you would like, without worrying what others think.</p>
<p>If you choose to do this, do not think that you are condemned to live alone forever. Welcome the men you like, and they will serve as masculine role models for your child.</p>
<p>You can even decide one day to live with a man — this will not cause any problems for your child at all. On the contrary, it will contribute to his or her fulfillment. A change of environment is always positive for a child.</p>
<p>Society should organize itself to take charge of the education of children partially or totally, depending on the parents' wishes. Those parents who want to work should be able to leave their children in the custody of competent people, and those who want their children to receive an education given entirely by such individuals should be able to entrust their children completely to establishments created for this purpose. In this way, if you give birth to a child you desired, but afterwards you separate from your companion, or for any other reason you no longer desire the child, you will be able to entrust your child to society, so that it may be brought up surrounded by the harmony necessary for its fulfillment, for a child who grows up in surroundings where it is not really and truly wanted cannot blossom and be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Bringing up a child should be mutually fulfilling for both parent and offspring. If a child becomes a nuisance, however slight, it realizes this and fulfillment is affected. A child should therefore be kept near you only if its presence is felt to be fulfilling.</p>
<p>Otherwise the child should be put in establishments that society must create to encourage fulfillment and be placed there without the least regret.</p>
<p>On the contrary, parents should feel a profound sense of joy because they are entrusting their child to others more capable than themselves of helping each little individual to blossom.</p>
<p>Regular visits can even take place if the children, whose wishes are of primary importance, would like them. The people in charge of the children's education should always describe the parents as exceptional people, who placed more importance on their children's fulfillment than on their own selfish pleasure of bringing them up themselves.</p>
<p>They did this, the children should be told, by entrusting them to people more competent than themselves.</p>
<p>Choose your partner freely if you desire one. Marriage, whether religious or civil, is useless. You cannot sign a contract to unite living individuals, who are bound to change because they are alive.</p>
<p>Reject marriage, which is only the public proclamation of ownership of a person. A man or woman cannot be the property of anyone else. Any contract can only destroy the harmony existing between two individuals.</p>
<p>When we feel loved, we feel free to love, but when we have signed a contract, we feel like prisoners who are forced to love each other, and sooner or later we begin to hate each other. So you will live with the person of your choice only for as long as you feel happy with him or her.</p>
<p>When you no longer get on well together, do not remain together, because your union will become hell. All living beings evolve, and  rightly so. If the personal evolution of each individual is similar, the union lasts, but if their progress is different, then union is no longer possible. You no longer like the individual you used to like because one of you has changed. You must part from each other while</p>
<p>retaining happy memories of your time together, instead of spoiling it with useless bickering which gives way to hostility. A child chooses clothes that fit, and when it outgrows them, they must be changed for different clothes, otherwise they will be torn to pieces. The same applies for unions; you must leave each other before being torn to pieces.</p>
<p>Above all, do not be worried about your child. It is better for him or her to be with only one parent in harmony than to be with both in discord, or lacking perfect harmony. Do not forget that children are, above all, individuals.</p>
<p>Society must make absolutely sure that old people have a happy life without any material worries. But although we must respect the elderly and do everything to make them happy, we should not listen to them just because of their seniority.</p>
<p>An intelligent person can give good advice at any age, but a stupid person, even if he is a hundred years old, does not deserve to be listened to for a second. What is more, such a person has no excuse, having had an entire lifetime in which to try to awaken, whereas there is still hope for a young and stupid person. But in any case, a stupid old person must still be able to live comfortably. This is a duty for
society.</p>
<p>Death should not be an occasion for sad gatherings; on the contrary, it should be a time of joyful celebration, because it is the moment when the beloved one may perhaps reach the paradise of the eternals in the company of our creators, the Elohim.</p>
<p>You will therefore ask not to be buried religiously, but you will donate your body to science, or you will ask that your body be disposed of as discreetly as possible, except for the bone of your forehead — more precisely the part located above the beginning of the nose, 33 millimeters (1.3 inches) above the middle of the axis linking the pupils of your eyes. At least one square centimeter (0.4 square inches) of this bone should be sent to the Guide of Guides, so that he may keep it in our embassy on Earth.</p>
<p>Each person is monitored by a computer that records all their actions and will make a tally of them at the end of their life. But people who know about this message which Claude Rael is communicating will be re-created from the cells that they have left in our embassy. In their cases, re-creation will take place only if they ensure that the required part of their body is sent to the Guide of Guides after their death.</p>
<p>The mechanism within the computer that records the information to be used in judgement of individuals remains in operation after they learn about the message. But the mechanism that allows an automatic sampling of a cell at the moment of death is disconnected.</p>
<p>So only those who comply exactly with what is required once they know about the message will be recreated.</p>
<p>Make sure that at least once in your life you see the Guide of Guides or a guide authorized by him to transmit your cellular plan to the Elohim, so that they may awaken your mind and help you to remain awakened.</p>
<p>In accordance with what is written earlier in this message, you will not leave an inheritance to your children, except for the family house or apartment. The rest you will leave in your will to the Guide of Guides, and if you fear your descendants might not respect your last will and testament but might try to recover your property through the courts, you will bestow it while you are alive on the Guide of Guides, in order to help him spread the message of our creators on Earth.</p>
<p>Those of you who remain after the death of a loved one, do not be sad and lament. Try instead to give love to those you love while they are still living, because once they are dead, what makes you unhappy is the thought that perhaps you did not love them enough, and that now it is too late.</p>
<p>Anyone who was good in their lifetime has the right to the Elohim's gardens for eternity and will know happiness, and anyone who was not good does not deserve to be missed.</p>
<p>But even if an individual is not among those chosen for re-creation, he or she does not really vanish. Death is not a very important thing, and we should not be afraid of it. It is just like falling asleep, except it is an endless sleep. Since we are a part of infinity, the matter of which we are made does not disappear. It continues to exist in the soil, or in plants, or even in animals, clearly losing all homogeneity and, therefore, all identity. This part of infinity that was organized by our creators according to a very precise plan returns to the infinite, while remaining a part of this small ball called Earth, which is alive.</p>
<p>Everyone has the right to live, the right to love and the right to die.</p>
<p>Everyone is the director of his or her own life and death. Death is nothing, but suffering is terrible, and everything must be done to eliminate it. Someone who is suffering too much has the right to commit suicide. If this person's actions were positive during his or her life, he or she will be admitted to the planet of the eternals.</p>
<p>If someone you love suffers very much and wishes to die, but does not have the strength to commit suicide, help them to take their own life.</p>
<p>When science one day enables you to eliminate human suffering, then you can ask yourselves whether it is right to commit suicide or not.</p>
<h2 id="society-and-government"><a class="header" href="#society-and-government">Society and Government</a></h2>
<p>Just as a human body has a brain to make decisions, it is essential that society also have a government to make decisions. So you will do everything you can to set up a government that practices geniocracy, which puts intelligence in power.</p>
<p>You will also participate in the creation of a worldwide political party advocating humanitarianism and geniocracy, as they are described in the first part of this message of the Elohim, and you will support its candidates. Only via geniocracy can humanity move fully into
the golden age.</p>
<p>Total democracy is not good. A body in which all the cells command cannot survive. Only intelligent people should be permitted to make decisions involving humanity. You will therefore refuse to vote, unless a candidate advocating geniocracy and humanitarianism is standing for election.</p>
<p>Neither universal suffrage nor public opinion polls are valid ways of governing the world. To govern is to foresee, not to follow the reactions of a sheep-like population, among whom only a very small number are sufficiently awakened to guide humanity. Since there are very few awakened people, if we base decisions on universal suffrage or opinion polls, the decisions become the choice of the majority — and therefore of those who are not awakened. Such people respond in the interests of their immediate gratification, or as a result of instinctive reactions that are unconsciously confined in a straitjacket of obscurantist conditioning.</p>
<p>Only geniocracy, which is a selective democracy, is worthwhile. As was stated in the first part of this message of the Elohim, only people whose net level of intelligence is fifty per cent above average should be eligible to stand for election, and only those whose net level of intelligence is ten per cent above the average should be eligible to vote. Scientists are already developing techniques to measure net intelligence. Follow their advice, and act in such a way that the most precious minerals of humanity —exceptionally gifted children— may receive an education at a level appropriate to their genius, since normal education is designed only for normal children of average
intelligence.</p>
<p>It is not the number of diplomas that one has obtained that signifies intelligence, since this only calls upon the rather uninteresting faculty of memory, which machines can replace.</p>
<p>Intelligence in its raw state is the quality that can make peasants or workers much more intelligent than engineers or professors. This can be spoken of as common sense, as well as creative genius, because most inventions are nothing more than a matter of common sense.</p>
<p>As already stated, to govern is to foresee, and all the great problems that humanity is now facing prove that past governments did not have foresight and were therefore incompetent governments. The problem does not lie with the people who govern, but rather, the technique that is used to choose them: the problem is the way we select those who govern us. Basic democracy must be replaced by a selective democracy — that is geniocracy, which puts intelligent people in power. This is a very fundamental requirement.</p>
<p>Human laws are indispensable, and you will respect them, while seeing to it that those that are unfair or obsolete are changed.</p>
<p>Between human laws and those of our creators, you will not hesitate one instant, as even the human judges will be judged some day by our creators.</p>
<p>The police will be essential for as long as it takes society to discover the medical means to eradicate violence and prevent criminals or those who infringe the freedom of others from acting out their anti-social impulses.</p>
<p>Unlike soldiers, who are the keepers of war, police officers are the keepers of peace, and they will remain indispensable until science has solved this problem.</p>
<p>In countries where compulsory military service exists, you will refuse to participate. Instead, ask to be granted the status of a conscientious objector, which will allow you to serve in a division that does not carry weapons, as is your right if your religious or philosophical convictions forbid you to kill your fellow human beings. This is the case for those who believe in the Elohim, our creators, and want to follow the directives of the Guide of Guides of the Raelian Movement.</p>
<p>Contrary to what many young people think, conscientious objectors are not sent to jail, but serve instead in some civilian role or in an unarmed division for a period that is double the normal duration of military service.</p>
<p>It is better to spend two years working in an office than to be trained for one year in techniques that enable you to kill fellow human beings.</p>
<p>Military service must be eliminated urgently in all the countries of the world. All professional soldiers must be transformed into guardians of world peace who work in the service of freedom and human rights.</p>
<p>The only system of government that is worthwhile is geniocracy applying humanitarianism. Capitalism is wrong because it enslaves people to money, benefiting a few on the backs of others.</p>
<p>Communism is also wrong, since it places greater importance on equality than on liberty. There must be equality among people at the beginning, at birth, but not afterwards.</p>
<p>Although everyone has the right to have sufficient means to live decently, those who do more for their fellow human beings have the right to receive more than those who do nothing for the community.</p>
<p>This is obviously a temporary rule until human beings can have robots to perform all menial labor, so that they can devote themselves exclusively to their fulfillment, after having totally abolished money.</p>
<p>In the meantime, it is shameful that while some people are dying of hunger, others throw food away to prevent prices collapsing. Instead of throwing away this food, they should distribute it to those who have nothing to eat.</p>
<p>Work must not be considered sacred. Everyone has the right to live comfortably, even if they do not work, and should try to fulfill themselves and blossom in whatever field attracts them. If people are organized, it will not take them long to mechanize and automate all indispensable work. Then everybody will be able to blossom freely.</p>
<p>If all individuals really set their minds to it, in only a few years freedom from the need to work could be attained. What is required is a marvelous burst of enthusiasm and solidarity in working for the liberation of humankind from material constraints.</p>
<p>All humanity's technical and scientific resources should be pooled, and all those working in these areas should truly set their minds on striving together for the well being of the entire community, rather than for vested interests. Use all the resources, which are currently wasted on military budgets or the inane development of nuclear weapons — or even flights into space. Such things could be better  planned and much more easily accomplished once humanity is free of material constraints.</p>
<p>You have computers and electronic equipment that can better replace manpower. Put them all to work, so that this technology can truly operate in the service of humankind. In a few years you can build a completely different world. You have reached the golden age.</p>
<p>Do everything possible to create the biological robot that will release you from all menial labor and enable you to blossom and fulfill yourselves.</p>
<p>Urban development must be reconsidered, as it is described in <em>The</em> <em>Book Which Tells The Truth</em>. You must build very tall communal houses situated in open country, so that individual houses do not &quot;devour&quot; nature. Never forget that if everyone had a country house with a small garden, there would be no more countryside. These communal houses must be cities that are equipped with everything people need and be capable of accommodating about 50,000 inhabitants each.</p>
<p>Until the day you become creators and can re-create it yourselves, you must respect nature. By respecting nature, you respect those who created it — our parents, the Elohim.</p>
<p>You will never make animals suffer. You may kill them to feed on their flesh, but do this without making them suffer. Although as already indicated, death is nothing, suffering is an abomination, and you must avoid making animals suffer, as you must prevent human beings from
suffering.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, do not eat too much meat, and you will feel better for it.</p>
<p>You may live on all that the land provides. You do not have to follow a special diet; you may eat meat, vegetables, fruits and other plants. But it is foolish to follow a vegetarian diet under the pretext that you do not want to live on the meat of other living creatures.</p>
<p>Plants are alive just as you are, and suffer in the same way that you do.</p>
<p>You must not cause suffering to plants that are alive, just as you are.</p>
<p>Do not intoxicate yourself with alcoholic beverages. You may drink a little wine while eating, for it is a product of the Earth. But never intoxicate yourself. You may drink alcoholic beverages in exceptional circumstances, but in very small quantities and accompanied by solid food so that you never get drunk. Anyone who is drunk is no longer capable of being in harmony with infinity, nor able to control himself.</p>
<p>This is something appalling in the eyes of our creators.</p>
<p>You will not smoke, for the human body was not made to inhale smoke. This has appalling effects on the organism and prevents total fulfillment and harmonization with infinity.</p>
<p>You will not use drugs. You will not drug yourself in any way, for the awakened mind needs nothing outside itself to approach infinity.</p>
<p>It is an abomination in the eyes of our creators that people think they must take drugs to improve themselves. Human beings have no need to improve themselves because all are perfect, having been made in the
image of our creators.</p>
<p>To say that a human being is imperfect is to insult our creators who made us in their image. But although we are perfect, we cease to be so if we think of ourselves as imperfect and remain resigned to such thoughts.</p>
<p>To remain perfect as the Elohim created us, we need to make an effort at every moment of the day to keep ourselves in an awakened state.</p>
<h3 id="meditation-and-prayer"><a class="header" href="#meditation-and-prayer">Meditation and Prayer</a></h3>
<p>You should meditate at least once each day, locating yourself in relation to infinity, in relation to the Elohim, to society, and yourself.</p>
<p>You should meditate upon awakening, so that your whole being becomes fully conscious of infinity, and you are placed in full possession of all your faculties.</p>
<p>You should meditate before each meal, so that all parts of your body eat when you eat; and when you nourish yourself, think of what you are doing.</p>
<p>Your meditation will not be a dry meditation, but on the contrary, a sensual meditation. You will let yourself be engulfed by peace and harmony until it becomes a pleasurable delight. Your meditation should not be forced labor, but a pleasure. It is better not to meditate at all than to meditate without really wanting to do so.</p>
<p>Do not impose meditation on your children or your family. But explain to them the pleasure that it gives and the sense of well-being that it brings, and if they then feel like meditating, try to teach them what you know.</p>
<p>Think intensely of the Elohim, our creators, at least once a day, and try to communicate with them telepathically. In this way you will rediscover the original meaning of prayer. If you do not know how to go about it, you can take your inspiration from the Lord's Prayer, the words of which are perfectly appropriate for communication with our creators.</p>
<p>At least once a week attempt group telepathic communication with the Elohim alongside other people from your region who believe in them. If possible, you should be accompanied by a Guide.</p>
<p>Do your very best every year to attend the meeting of all those who believe in the Elohim and in the message they have given to the last of the prophets.</p>
<h3 id="technique-for-attempting-telepathic-contact-with-the-elohim"><a class="header" href="#technique-for-attempting-telepathic-contact-with-the-elohim">TECHNIQUE FOR ATTEMPTING TELEPATHIC CONTACT WITH THE ELOHIM</a></h3>
<p>Here is a model of what you could say while looking towards the sky and thinking intensely about the words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elohim, you are there somewhere near those stars.</p>
<p>Elohim, you are there, and I know you are watching us.</p>
<p>Elohim, you are there, and I would so much like to meet you.</p>
<p>Elohim, you are there, and what am I to hope to deserve a contact?</p>
<p>Elohim, I recognize you as our creators, and I place myself humbly at your service.</p>
<p>Elohim, I recognize Claude Rael, your messenger, as my guide, and I believe in him and in the message you gave him.</p>
<p>Elohim, I will do my best to make the message known to those around me because I know I have not done enough.</p>
<p>Elohim, I love all human beings as my brothers and sisters because they are made in your image.</p>
<p>Elohim, I am trying to bring them happiness by opening their minds to infinity and revealing to them what was revealed to me.</p>
<p>Elohim, I am trying to stop their suffering by placing my whole being at the service of humankind, of which I am a part.</p>
<p>Elohim, I am trying to use to the utmost the mind you have given me, to help humankind emerge from darkness and suffering.</p>
<p>Elohim, I hope that you will judge the little I have done by the end of my life to be sufficient to grant me the right to eternal life on the planet of the wise.</p>
<p>I love you, as you must have loved human beings to admit the best of them among your eternals.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-arts"><a class="header" href="#the-arts">The Arts</a></h2>
<p>Do as much as possible to encourage artists and to help your child if he or she is attracted by the arts. Art is one of the things which best enables you to harmonize with infinity. Consider every natural thing an art, and every art a natural thing. Surround yourself with artistic things, whether they appeal to your ears, your eyes, your sense of touch, smell or taste.</p>
<p>Everything, which appeals to the senses, is artistic. There is more than just music, painting, sculpture and all the officially recognized arts.</p>
<p>Gastronomy is also an art, as well as perfume making, since they both appeal to the senses. Standing above all finally, love is an art.</p>
<p>All art makes use of harmony, and therefore allows those who appreciate it to be taken over by something harmonious. This consequently produces the right conditions for placing oneself in harmony with infinity.</p>
<p>Literature is particularly important because it contributes to opening people's minds by showing them new horizons. But literature for literature's sake is just prattle: what counts is not writing beautiful sentences, but the transmission of new ideas to others through reading. Audiovisual means are even more important, for they appeal to our senses of sight and hearing at the same time. They could well replace literature, since they are more complete.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, literature is useful for the time being.</p>
<h2 id="sensual-meditation"><a class="header" href="#sensual-meditation">Sensual Meditation</a></h2>
<p>If you want to reach a high level of harmony with infinity, arrange a place of sensual meditation for yourself. Place in it works of art, paintings, reproductions, tapestries, posters, sculptures, drawings, photographs or anything else that is intended to represent love,
infinity and sensuality, for the enjoyment of your eyes.</p>
<p>Arrange for yourself a corner where you can sit close to the ground, on cushions, for example. Or lie down on a couch or on fur, for the pleasure of touching it. Evaporate agreeable scents and oils to please your nose. Have a tape recorder and a cassette on which you have recorded music that you like for the pleasure of your ears.</p>
<p>Have trays and bottles filled with food and drink that you like for the pleasure of your mouth, and invite one or several people you love, who share your tastes and with whom you feel at ease and in</p>
<p>harmony; then feed your senses together and open your bodies in order to open your minds in love and fraternity.</p>
<p>If someone appeals to you physically, and you feel that it is reciprocal, invite him or her to this place. Together you can reach a sublime state of harmony, which will enable you to approach infinity by satisfying your five senses. To this state will be added the synthesis of all these pleasures — the physical union of two individuals in total harmony and in the illumination of the act of love.</p>
<p>Obviously, the harmony must first exist spiritually. In other words, there must be a mutual attraction between the minds, and thus, the bodies of the individuals in the way they approach and respect each other. But a spiritual love is always made sublime by a fulfilled physical love. To love is to give and expect nothing in exchange. If you love somebody, you should give yourself to this person entirely if he or she desires it.</p>
<p>Never be jealous, for jealousy is the opposite emotion to love.</p>
<p>When you love someone, you must seek his or her happiness first and foremost, and in every way. To love is to seek the happiness of others, and not your own.</p>
<p>If the person you love is attracted to another, do not be jealous; on the contrary, be happy that the one you love is happy, even if it is because of somebody else.</p>
<p>Love also the person who, like you, wants to bring happiness to the person you love, and who therefore has the same goal as you. Jealousy is the fear that someone else may make the person you love happier than you do yourself, and that you may lose the one you love. But instead of feeling jealous, we should try to do as much as possible to make the person we love happy, and if somebody else succeeds better in this, we should be happy about it. What counts is not that our beloved be happy because of us but simply that they be happy, whoever is responsible.</p>
<p>So if the person you love is happy with somebody else, rejoice in this happiness. You will recognize the person who loves you in that he or she will not oppose your happiness with someone else.</p>
<p>It is your duty to love the person who loves you that much and to give him or her happiness yourself. In that direction lies the path of universal love.</p>
<p>Do not reject someone who wants to make you happy, for by accepting that he does so, you make him happy, and this is an act of love. Rejoice in the happiness of others, so that they may rejoice in yours.</p>
<h2 id="human-justice"><a class="header" href="#human-justice">Human Justice</a></h2>
<p>Between human laws and those of our creators, you will not hesitate one instant, as even the human judges will be judged some day by our creators.</p>
<p>Human laws, as already stated, are essential. But they must be improved upon because they do not take love and fraternity sufficiently into consideration.</p>
<p>The death penalty must be abolished because no individual has the right to kill another coldly in a premeditated, organized manner.</p>
<p>Until the time comes when through science, society is able to control the violence that occurs in some people and can cure them of their illness, you will keep criminals apart from society. Then give them the love that they have lacked, while trying to make them understand the monstrous nature of their actions. Give them also the desire to redeem themselves.</p>
<p>Do not mix hardened criminals —who are suffering from an illness that can be contagious— with people who have merely committed petty offenses. That way you will avoid contaminating the lesser offenders.</p>
<p>Never forget that all criminals are sick, and always consider them as such. We are shocked when we remember that once upon a time we used to suffocate people between mattresses if they suffered from fits of hysteria. Some day, when we are able to cure, and more importantly, prevent the sickness of crime, we will be just as shocked when we look back at how we used to execute criminals.</p>
<p>Forgive those who have done you harm unintentionally, and bear no grudge against those who have willingly done you harm. They are ill, for one must be ill to harm one's neighbor. Besides, think how unfortunate those people are, who do harm others, because they will not have the right to eternal life in the gardens of the Elohim.</p>
<p>But if someone wants to harm you or those you love, try to subdue them. If you cannot, then you have the right to defend yourself to save your own life or the lives of your loved ones. However, never strike with the intention to kill, even in legitimate defense. Try only to render the person harmless — by knocking him or her out, for example. If the blow you give turns out to be fatal, you have nothing to blame yourself for, as long as you did not have the intention to kill.</p>
<p>You will subdue violent people by non-violence, and if necessary, by direct action. Violent behavior is intolerable, and you will not tolerate it, even if you have to forcibly restrain violent people. But always use a non-violent force, that is to say, a balanced force applied without malicious intent, sufficient only to overcome those who try to do harm.</p>
<p>Any threat of violence should be treated as seriously as an actual violent deed. To threaten violence is to think it possible and to see it as an acceptable way of achieving one's goals. A person capable of threatening another with violence is as dangerous as someone who has already committed a violent act. Until we can find a medical cure for those who make such threats, they must be kept outside society, and
we must try to make them understand that their behavior is dreadful.</p>
<p>When dealing with those who take hostages, think first of the lives of innocent people who are in the hands of the hostage-takers. People who take hostages are sick, and you should not give them what they demand. Society, in fact, must never give in to them because by doing so, you encourage other criminals to copy such actions and give credence to their threats.</p>
<p>All human beings must have equal rights and opportunities at birth, whatever race they may be. Discriminate against fools, however, whatever the color of their skin. All the races that populate the Earth were created by the Elohim, and must be equally respected.</p>
<p>Humanity as a whole must unite to form a world government, as it is written in <em>The Book Which Tells The Truth</em>. Impose also a new world language on all the school children of the entire world.</p>
<p>Esperanto exists, and if no one proposes anything better, choose Esperanto.</p>
<p>Until it becomes possible to abolish money, create a new world currency to replace national currencies. Therein lies the solution to the monetary crisis. If no one can propose anything better, use the federalist system. Create a federation from all the countries of the world. Grant independence to regions, which need to be able to organize themselves as they wish.</p>
<p>The world will live in harmony when it is no longer composed of separate countries, but consists instead of regions united in a federation to take charge of the destiny of the Earth.</p>
<h2 id="science"><a class="header" href="#science">Science</a></h2>
<p>Science is the most important thing of all for humanity. You will keep yourself in touch with the advances made by scientists who can solve all problems. Do not let scientific discoveries fall into the hands of those who think only of making profit, nor into the hands of the military who keep certain inventions secret in order to retain a hypothetical supremacy over illusory enemies.</p>
<p>Science should be your religion, for the Elohim created you scientifically.</p>
<p>By being scientific, you please your creators because you are acting as they do, and you show them that you understand that you were made in their image and are anxious to take advantage of all the potential that you have within you. Science must be used to serve and liberate humankind, not to destroy and alienate it. Trust those scientists who are not being manipulated by financial interests, and only them.</p>
<p>You may participate in sports, for they are very good for your equilibrium — particularly those sports that develop self-control.</p>
<p>Society should also authorize violent, and even very violent, sports.</p>
<p>These are safety valves. An evolved and non-violent society must have violent games that maintain an image of violence, enabling young people who wish it, to be violent with others who wish the same thing. This also allows others to watch these violent exhibitions and so release their aggressive energies.</p>
<p>You may participate in games that require thought and use of the mind. But as long as money has not been abolished, never play to win money; rather play for the pleasure of making your mind function.</p>
<p>You will date your writings counting the year 1946 as &quot;year one&quot;, after Claude Rael, the last of the prophets. Then 1976 is therefore year 31 after Claude Rael, or year 31 of the era of Aquarius, or year 31 of the age of the Apocalypse, or year 31 of the golden age.</p>
<h2 id="the-human-brain"><a class="header" href="#the-human-brain">The Human Brain</a></h2>
<p>We still have a long way to go in fully understanding the potential of the human brain. The sixth sense, direct perception, should be developed in young children. This is what we call telepathy. Telepathy enables us to communicate directly with our creators, the Elohim.</p>
<p>Numerous mediums have come to me asking what they should do, because they had received messages from what they call &quot;the beyond&quot;, asking them to get in touch with me in order to help me, and for me to bring them &quot;the light&quot;. Mediums are very important people because they have an above average gift of telepathy, and their minds are already on the path to an awakened state. They should try to practice meditation in order to fully master their potential.</p>
<p>I am eagerly waiting for all those mediums who have received such messages to get in touch with me, so that we may organize regular meetings. The true mediums who seek to be informed will all receive instructions. The power of one brain is great, but the power of several brains is infinite. Let those who have ears, hear.</p>
<p>Never forget that all those things, which you do not understand and which scientists cannot explain, have been created by the Elohim.</p>
<p>The clockmaker knows all the parts of the clock he has made.</p>
<h2 id="the-apocalypse"><a class="header" href="#the-apocalypse">The Apocalypse</a></h2>
<p>Do not forget that the Apocalypse —literally the &quot;age of revelation&quot;— has arrived as was predicted. It has been said that when the time comes, there will be many false prophets. You only have to look around you to see that the time has indeed come. False prophets are writers of horoscopes of which the newspapers are full, and there are also many others who reject the benefits of science and cling to every last letter of ancient writings that were the messages given by the Elohim to the primitive people of ancient times.</p>
<p>Such false prophets prefer to believe what narrow-minded and primitive people have fearfully copied down long ago while listening to those whom they considered to be gods because they came from the sky. They should instead believe the message of the Elohim that has been given now to people who no longer kneel stupidly before all that comes from the sky. These latter people try to understand the universe, and they can be addressed as adults.</p>
<p>But if you look around, you will see the crowds of fanatic and obscurantist religious sects, which attract young impressionable people thirsty for the truth.</p>
<p>A philosopher once said: 'Jesus came to show people the path to follow, and everybody kept staring at his finger.' Meditate on this sentence. It is not the messenger who matters, but the person who sends the message, and the message itself.</p>
<p>Do not go astray among the sects of the East — the truth is not on top of the Himalayas any more than in Peru or elsewhere. The truth is within you.</p>
<p>But if you want to travel, and you like exotic places, go to all these distant countries. You will understand then that you have wasted your time, and that what you were looking for was inside you all the time.</p>
<p>Travel within yourself, otherwise you are only a tourist — someone who passes by and thinks he or she will find the truth by watching others search for it within themselves. They may find it, perhaps, but those watching them certainly will not. To travel inside yourself, you do not need to take a plane.</p>
<p>The East has nothing to teach the West about wisdom and awakening the mind. Rather, the opposite is true. How can you find wisdom amongst people who die from hunger as they watch herds of sacred cows go by?</p>
<p>On the contrary, it is the West with its intellect and its science that comes to help people who, for ages, have been shackled by primitive and murderous beliefs. It is not by chance that countries in the West no longer face the same problems as those of the Third World. Where the mind rules, the body does not die of hunger. Where obscurantism  prevails, the body cannot survive. Can primitive people solve the problems of famine in the world and give food to those who are starving? They already have enough difficulties trying to feed themselves, and you expect to find wisdom there?</p>
<p>All the people of the Earth had the same chances at the beginning.</p>
<p>Some have solved their problems, and even have more than they need, while others simply do not have the means to survive. In your opinion, which ones can help the others? The people of the West still have an enormous distance to go on the path of open-mindedness, but the people of the East have not achieved one tenth of what the people of the West have achieved.</p>
<h2 id="telepathic-communication"><a class="header" href="#telepathic-communication">Telepathic Communication</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Mind and matter are eternally the same thing.</p>
<p><em>— The Tibetan Book of the Dead</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to have telepathic communication of a very high quality, do not cut your hair or your beard. Certain people have a telepathic organ that is sufficiently developed to work well even if their head is shaved. But if you want to achieve the best results, then do not cut what the creators have made grow on your head and face. If it grows, there is a reason, for none of your physical characteristics were given to you without reason. By respecting the creation, you respect the creator.</p>
<p>The best moment to enter into communication with your creators is on waking because as your body is emerging from sleep, your mind is re-awakening too. A mechanism starts up at that point, a mechanism, which you must activate by deliberately opening your mind as far as possible to everything around you and to infinity. You should take special care not to halt the process.</p>
<p>Sit down cross-legged, or better still, lie on your back on the ground. If possible, position yourself in the open air and look up towards the sky.</p>
<p>The mind is like a rose. In the morning, it begins to open, but you often prune it when it is still just a bud. If you would wait a little, it would bloom.</p>
<p>To practice physical fitness is good, but to practice the physical fitness of the mind is better.</p>
<p>Yet, do not be impatient if you do not obtain results right away.</p>
<p>When an organ is not used, it atrophies. When you have had a limb in plaster for a long time, you need a lot of physical therapy to recover its normal use.</p>
<p>Look up to the sky and think of your position in the context of everything that surrounds you. Visualize yourself in relation to the house that you occupy, a tiny speck lost between stone walls. See yourself in relation to all the people who are waking up at the same time as you, and in relation to those who, in other parts of the globe, are going to bed. Think of all those who are being born, those who are uniting with each other physically, those who are suffering, working or dying at that time, all this while you are waking up.</p>
<p>Situate yourself in regard to your own level.</p>
<p>Situate yourself in relation to the infinitely large as well. Think of the town where you are, a tiny speck lost in a landscape that is the country, the continent or the island where you live. Then fly away in your mind, as if you were in a plane travelling further and further away from the ground, until the town and then the continent are nothing but a tiny spot.</p>
<p>Be aware of the fact that you are on the Earth, a small ball where humanity is but a parasite. It is always spinning although you do not realize this is happening. Situate yourself in relation to it, and in relation to the moon, which is revolving around the Earth, and in relation to the Earth, which is revolving around the sun, and in relation to the sun, which is itself rotating as it revolves around the center of our galaxy. Situate yourself in relation to the stars that are also suns, which have planets orbiting them. On these planets an  infinite number of other beings live, and among them is the planet of our creators, the Elohim, as well as the planet of the eternals, where you may one day be admitted for eternity.</p>
<p>Locate yourself in relation to all those worlds where other living beings live — some more advanced and some more primitive than we are, and in relation to those galaxies which themselves revolve around the center of the universe. Finally, situate yourself in relation to our whole universe, which itself is an atom of an atom of a molecule located perhaps in the arm of somebody who is looking up at the sky, wondering whether there is life on other planets...</p>
<p><em>This is all in relation to the infinitely large.</em></p>
<p>Then situate yourself also in relation to your body, to all its vital organs and the other parts of which it is made up. Think of all those organs that are working without your noticing it, right at this very moment.</p>
<p>Think of your heart, which is beating without your asking it to, your blood, which circulates and irrigates your whole body, and your brain, which enables you to reflect and be conscious of doing so.</p>
<p>Think of all the corpuscles that make up your blood and of all the cells that are being born in your body, those feeling pleasure while reproducing and those that are dying without your knowing it, and perhaps without being conscious that they help form the individual that you are.</p>
<p>Think too of all the molecules that constitute these cells, and the atoms that constitute these molecules, revolving like suns around the center of a galaxy, and of the particles that make up these atoms, and of the particles of these particles on which there is life asking itself if there is life on other planets...</p>
<p><em>This is all in relation to the infinitely small.</em></p>
<p>Place yourself in harmony with the infinitely large and with the infinitely small by radiating love towards what is above and towards what is below, and by being conscious that you yourself are part of infinity. Then by thinking intensely, try to transmit your message of love to the Elohim, our creators; try to transmit to them your wish to see them, to be among them one day, to have the strength to deserve
it, to be among the chosen ones. Then you will feel light and ready to do good around you with all your strength all day long, because you will be in harmony with infinity.</p>
<p>You may also do these exercises in the sensual meditation room during the day, alone or with other people. But the moment when you come closest to perfect harmony with the infinite will occur when this takes place in your room of sensual meditation with someone you love, and you unite yourself physically with him or her, and jointly harmonize yourselves with infinity during your union.</p>
<p>In the evening, when the sky is full of stars and the temperature is mild, lie down on the ground. Look up at the heavens and think intensely of the Elohim, wishing that some day you may deserve to be amongst them, and thinking strongly that you are available and ready to do exactly what they may ask of you, even if you do not clearly understand why they are asking it. Perhaps you will see a signal if you are sufficiently ready.</p>
<p>As you are lying there on your back, be aware of the extent to which your organs of perception are limited, which explains the difficulty you may have in conceiving of infinity. A force keeps you nailed to the ground, you cannot fly off to the stars with a jerk, and yet you do not see any rope holding you down.</p>
<p>Millions of people are listening to thousands of radio stations and watching hundreds of television programs that are being broadcast in the atmosphere, yet you do not see these waves of sound and vision, and you do not hear them. Compasses all have their points drawn to the north, and yet you neither see nor hear the forces that attract their needles.</p>
<p>So I repeat again: your organs of perception are very limited, and energies like the universe are infinite. Wake yourself up, and wake up the organs you have within you, which will allow you to receive waves that you are not yet picking up or do not even suspect. Simple pigeons are able to find the north, and you, a human being, cannot.</p>
<p>Think about this for a moment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, teach your children, whose organs are developing, all about this. This is how the &quot;new humanity&quot; will be born, and their faculties will be infinitely superior to those of present human beings.</p>
<p>When his growth is finished, a man who has never learned to walk will always be a cripple, and even if he is taught later, he will always be handicapped, even if he is very gifted. Therefore, it is during their growth that you must open the minds of your children, so that all their faculties may blossom, and they will turn into individuals who have nothing in common with what we are: poor, narrow-minded, primitive people.</p>
<h2 id="the-reward"><a class="header" href="#the-reward">The Reward</a></h2>
<p>May this book guide those who recognize and love our creators, the Elohim. May it guide those who believe in them and those who remember to communicate telepathically with them, thus</p>
<p>rediscovering the original meaning of prayer. May it guide those who do good to their fellow human beings. May it guide those who believe in what was revealed to me and in what was revealed before me, and those who are sure that scientific reincarnation is a reality. All such people have a guide and an aim in life, and are happy.</p>
<p>As for those who are not awakened, it is useless to speak to them about this message of the Elohim. One who is asleep cannot hear, and the unconscious mind does not wake up in just a few moments — especially if the person sleeping finds his or her sleep very comfortable.</p>
<p>Spread this message around you to those who do good to their fellow human beings. Spread it particularly among those who, by using the mind that the Elohim gave them, are relieving society from fear of food shortages, disease and the burden of daily exertions. They do this by giving others time to fulfill themselves and blossom, and it is for such individuals that the fountained gardens of the planet of the eternals are reserved.</p>
<p>For it is not enough merely to avoid harming others without doing them any good. Anyone whose life has been neutral will be entitled to neutrality. That is to say, he will not be re-created, neither to pay for crimes which have not been committed, nor to receive the reward for non-existent good deeds.</p>
<p>Anyone who has made many people suffer during part of his life, and then makes up for it by doing as much good as harm, will also be neutral. To have the right to scientific reincarnation on the planet of the eternals, one must have an unambiguously positive assessment at the end of one's life.</p>
<p>To be satisfied with doing good on a small scale around oneself is enough for someone who is not of superior intelligence, or who does not have many means, but it is not enough for someone who is very intelligent or someone who has many means. A very intelligent person has a duty to use the mind given to them by the Elohim to bring happiness to others by inventing new techniques to improve their living conditions.</p>
<p>Those people who will be entitled to scientific reincarnation on the planet of the eternals will live in a world where food will be brought to them without their having to make the slightest effort, and where there will be marvelously beautiful female and male partners scientifically created for the sole purpose of satisfying their pleasures.</p>
<p>They will live there eternally, seeking only to fulfill themselves doing whatever pleases them. As for those who have made others suffer, they will be re-created, and their suffering will be equal to the pleasure of the eternals.</p>
<p>How can you not believe in all this now that science and ancient religions are coming together perfectly? You were nothing but matter, mere dust, yet the Elohim made you into living beings in their image capable of dominating matter. Later you will again become matter or dust, and they will make you live once more as they have created you, scientifically.</p>
<p>The Elohim created the first human beings without knowing that they were doing what had already been done for them. They thought they were only conducting a minor scientific experiment, and that is why they destroyed almost all of humanity the first time.</p>
<p>But when they understood that they had been created just like us, they began to love us as their own children, and swore never to try to destroy us again, leaving us to overcome our own violence by ourselves.</p>
<p>Although the Elohim do not directly intervene for or against humanity as a whole, they do, however, exert influence on some individuals whose actions please or displease them. Woe to those claiming to have met the Elohim or to have received a message from them if it is not true. Their life will become hell, and they will regret their lie when faced with all the troubles they will encounter.</p>
<p>Also those who act against the Guide of Guides and try to prevent him carrying out his mission, or who go along with him in order to spread strife amongst those who follow him, they will also see their life become hell.</p>
<p>Without any obvious influence coming from above, they will know why disease, family and professional difficulties, emotional woes and other problems will all invade their earthly existence while they await their eternal punishment.</p>
<p>You who smile as you read these lines, you are among those who would have crucified Jesus if you had lived in his time. Yet now you want to see members of your family born, get married and die under his effigy because this has become part of the morals and customs.</p>
<p>Behaving like those who went to see the lions devouring the first Christians, you also direct ironic smiles at those who believe in these writings, saying that they should spend some time in a psychiatric asylum. Nowadays, when someone has disturbing ideas, he is no longer crucified or fed to wild animals — this is far too barbaric.</p>
<p>Rather, such people are sent to a psychiatric asylum. Had these establishments existed two thousand years ago, Jesus and those who believed in him would have been confined there. As for those who believe in eternal life, ask them why they weep when they lose a loved one.</p>
<p>For as long as humankind was unable to understand the work of the Elohim scientifically, it was natural for people to believe in an impalpable &quot;God&quot;. But now that, thanks to science, you understand that matter is infinitely large and infinitely small, you no longer have an excuse to believe in the &quot;God&quot; that your primitive ancestors believed in. The Elohim, our creators, intend to be recognized by those who are capable now of understanding how life can be created and can make the appropriate comparisons with ancient writings.</p>
<p>Those people will have the right to eternity.</p>
<p>Christians! You have read a hundred times that Jesus would return, yet if he came back, you would put him in a psychiatric asylum.</p>
<p>Come, open your eyes.</p>
<p>Sons of Israel! You are still waiting for your Messiah, and yet you do not open the door.</p>
<p>Buddhists! Your writings indicate that the new Buddha will be born in the West. Recognize the anticipated signs.</p>
<p>Muslims! Mohammed reminded you that the Jewish people had made an error in killing the prophets, and that the Christians had also made an error in adoring their prophet more than the one who sent him. So welcome the last of the prophets, and love those who sent him.</p>
<p>If you recognize the Elohim as your creators, and if you love them and wish to welcome them, if you try to do good to other people by making as much use as you can of all your potential, if you think of your creators regularly, trying through telepathy to make them understand that you love them, if you help the Guide of Guides to accomplish his mission, you will without a doubt be entitled to scientific reincarnation on the planet of the eternals.</p>
<p>When humanity discovered the necessary form of energy to travel to the moon, it also came to possess sufficient energy to destroy all life on Earth.</p>
<p>'The hour has drawn near, and the moon is rent asunder' it says in the <em>Koran, Sura 54, Verse 1</em>. Therefore, any day now, humanity can destroy itself. Only those who follow the last of the prophets will be saved from destruction.</p>
<p>Long ago, people did not believe Noah, and they laughed at him when he made preparations for the destruction. But they did not have the last laugh.</p>
<p>When the Elohim told the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah to leave the city without looking back, some did not heed those warnings and were destroyed. Now that we have reached the stage when humanity itself may destroy all life on Earth, only those who recognize the Elohim as their creators will be saved from destruction.</p>
<p>You may still not believe any of this, but when the time comes, you will think of these lines again, and it will be too late.</p>
<p>When the cataclysm takes place —and there is a good chance that it will happen quite soon, given the way human beings are presently behaving— there will be two sorts of people: those who have not recognized their creators and have not followed the last of the prophets, and those who have opened their eyes and ears and recognized what was announced a long time ago.</p>
<p>The former will undergo the suffering and destruction in the final furnace, and the latter will be spared and taken with the Guide of Guides to the planet of the eternals. There they will enjoy a marvelous life of fulfillment and pleasure with the sages of ancient times. It is they who will be waited on by magnificent athletes with beautifully sculptured bodies who will bring them sophisticated food to savor in the company of men and women of unequalled beauty and charm who will be entirely compliant to their desires.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seated on couches wrought with gold and jewels, Reclining thereon facing each other,</p>
<p>There will wait on them youths, who will not age,</p>
<p>Carrying goblets and ewers and cups filled out of a flowing spring,</p>
<p>No headache will they get therefrom, nor will they be intoxicated,</p>
<p>And carrying such fruits as they choose,</p>
<p>And flesh of birds as they may desire,</p>
<p>And there will be fair maidens with wide,</p>
<p>Lovely eyes,</p>
<p>Like pearls, we preserved,</p>
<p>As a reward for what they did.</p>
<p><em>The Koran, Sura 56, Verses 15-24.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You who believe in all that is written here, when the Guide of Guides summons you somewhere, drop everything, for it might be because he has received some information concerning the end. If you are near him at that moment, you will be saved and taken away with him, far from the suffering.</p>
<p>You who believe, do not pass judgement on the words or deeds of the Elohim. The created does not have the right to judge his creator.</p>
<p>Respect our prophet, and do not pass judgement on his actions or his words, for we hear through his ears, we see through his eyes, and we speak through his mouth. If you lack respect for the prophet, you lack respect for those who sent him, your creators.</p>
<p>The messages which were given earlier by the Elohim and all those people who adhered fully to them over the centuries were right. But the obscurantist systems that were built on these messages using those who had a feeling for them were wrong. The Church is in the process of disappearing, and it deserves just that.</p>
<p>As for the men and women of the Church, let those who have their eyes open join the last of the prophets and help him spread throughout the world the latest message that has been handed to him.</p>
<p>He will welcome them with open arms, and they will be able to blossom and fulfill themselves completely, while remaining the messengers of those in whom they had always believed. But this time they will at last truly comprehend what the Elohim's task was when they created humanity and when they sent Jesus.</p>
<p>They will really be able to fulfill themselves, far from the constraints of the Church, which is fossilized and encrusted with crimes and criminal inquisitions thousands of years old. They will be able to do what they must do — make use of the organs their creators gave them, for our creators do not like us failing to use the organs they gave us.</p>
<p>The men and women of the Church will be able to enjoy their five senses and unite physically forever, or for an instant of happiness with whomsoever they please, without feeling guilty. It is now that they should feel guilty — guilty of not using all that was given to them by their creators. But released from their old constraints, they will truly open people's minds instead of putting them to sleep!</p>
<p>Already, there are almost no more seminarists, but people who are unhappy — those who have in them the vocation to bring love around them and to open people's minds. Fifty years ago there were 50,000 seminarists; now there are only 500; this means that there are at least 49,500 unhappy people, human beings who have in them the potential, which has been placed in them by our creators so that they use it, to radiate. However, they do not feel attracted to this church shrouded with crimes and darkness.</p>
<p>You who are among those 49,500 people feeling a need to radiate the truth and do something for your fellow people; you who want to remain faithful to your creators and to Jesus who told you to love one another and to respect your creators, <em>&quot;the Father who art in heaven&quot;;</em> you who feel that this message is true, come with us and become Guides, that is to say, people who devote themselves to the Elohim in the tradition of Moses, Elijah and Jesus, and to the spreading of their messages, while continuing to live a normal life, truly fulfilling yourselves and enjoying all the senses that your creators gave you.</p>
<p>You who are presently members of the Church, take off those clothes that are as sad as their color, the color of the crimes that have been committed under their facade. Come with us and become guides for humanity on the path of universal peace and love.</p>
<p>Leave those churches that are nothing but monuments built by primitive people, temples where they could adore worthless things — pieces of wood and metal. The Elohim do not need temples in every city to feel loved. It is sufficient that human beings try to communicate with them telepathically, thereby rediscovering the original meaning of prayer, but also opening themselves to infinity and not shutting themselves away in obscure, mystical stone buildings.</p>
<p>Hypocrisy and mystification have lasted long enough. Using truthful messages as their basis, organizations were built and grew fat on them, living in misplaced luxury and using people's fear to achieve their own ends. Wars were even waged under the pretext of spreading these messages abroad. Shame!</p>
<p>The money of the poor has been used to build a financial power base. Shame!</p>
<p>Love for one's neighbor has been preached with weapons in hand. Shame!</p>
<p>Human equality has been preached while supporting dictatorships. Shame!</p>
<p>'God is with us!' was said to encourage people to launch themselves into fratricidal wars. Shame!</p>
<p>Many times has the following Gospel passage been quoted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.</p>
<p><em>— Matthew 23: 9</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet in the Church they make sure they themselves are constantly called &quot;Father&quot; and &quot;Monsignor&quot; and &quot;My Lord&quot;. Shame!</p>
<p>Other texts have been read again and again that say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses, nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves.</p>
<p><em>— Matthew 10: 9-10.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet they have been wallowing in the luxury of the Vatican. Shame!</p>
<p>The Pope, if he does not sell all the properties of the Vatican to help unfortunate people, will not be admitted among the righteous on the planet of the eternals. It is shameful to wallow in luxury acquired at the expense of poor people by using true messages and by exploiting the births, marriages and deaths of human beings.</p>
<p>If all this changes, and if those people who were a part of that monstrous organization without understanding their mistake now leave it and regret their error, they will be forgiven and entitled to eternity. For the Elohim, our creators, love us, their children, and forgive all those who sincerely regret their errors.</p>
<p>The Church has no reason to exist any longer, for it was entrusted with spreading the message of Jesus in anticipation of the age of the Apocalypse, and this age has now come. Also the Church has used methods of disseminating information that are a shame to it.</p>
<p>Although it has accomplished its mission, the Church will be reproached for all its crimes, and those who still wear its clothes covered with blood will be among the guilty.</p>
<p>Wake up slumberer that you are! This is no fabricated story. Reread all the writings of the ancient prophets, inform yourself about the most recent scientific discoveries —especially in biology— and look at the sky.</p>
<p>The predicted signs are there. The UFOs —unidentified flying objects— which mankind has dubbed &quot;flying saucers&quot;, are appearing every day.</p>
<p>'<em>There will be signs in the sky</em>' — that was written a long time ago. Once you have informed yourself of these things, integrate them all in your mind, and wake up. Claude Rael exists, he is indeed alive, and he has not written what Moses, Ezekiel, Elijah, Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha and all the others wrote. He is not a biologist, but he is the last of the line of prophets, the prophet of the Apocalypse — that is, of the time when everything can be understood.</p>
<p>He is living among you right now; you are lucky enough to be one of his contemporaries, and you are able to receive his teaching. Wake up! Pull yourself together, and take to the road. Go and see him, and help him — he needs you. You will be one of the pioneers of the final religion, the religion of religions, and you will have your place, whatever may happen, among the righteous for eternity, savoring the delights of the planet of the eternals in the company of wonderfully pleasant beings who are ready to fulfill all your desires.</p>
<h2 id="the-guides"><a class="header" href="#the-guides">The Guides</a></h2>
<p>You will follow the Guide of Guides, for he is the ambassador of the Elohim, our creators, &quot;our Fathers who art in Heaven&quot;. You will follow all the advice that is given in this book, because it is the advice of your creators, transmitted by Claude Rael, our ambassador, the last of the prophets, the shepherd of shepherds, and you will help him to build the religion of religions.</p>
<p>Jews, Christians, Muslims, Buddhists and all you who have other religions, open your eyes and your ears; re-read your holy writings, and you will understand that this book is the last one — the one predicted by your own prophets. Come and join us to prepare for the coming of our creators.</p>
<p>Write to the Guide of Guides, and he will put you in touch with other people who, like you, are Raelians — that is, people who understand the message transmitted by Claude Rael. He will put you in touch with a Guide in your region, so that you may meet regularly to meditate and act to spread this message, so that it becomes known throughout the world.</p>
<p>You who are reading this message, be aware that you are privileged, and think of all those who do not yet know about it. Do all you can to make sure that no one around you is ignorant of these fantastic revelations, without ever trying to convince those to whom you speak. Bring this message to their notice, and if they are ready, they will open up by themselves.</p>
<p>Constantly repeat to yourself this sentence of Gandhi: <em>'It's not because no one sees the truth that it becomes an error.'</em></p>
<p>You who feel such joy in reading this message, and who wish to radiate this truth and make it shine around you, you who want to live by devoting yourself totally to our creators, by scrupulously applying what they ask, by training to guide humanity on the path of blossoming and fulfillment, you should become a Guide if you want to be fully capable of this.</p>
<p>Write to the Guide of Guides, to Claude Rael, and he will welcome you and arrange an initiation, which will enable you to radiate this truth fully; for you can open the minds of others only if your own mind is open.</p>
<p>The love of the creators for their work is immense, and you should return this love to them. You must love them as they love you, and prove it by assisting their ambassador and his helpers, putting all your means and all your strength at their service, so that they may travel all over the world to spread this message and build an embassy to welcome our creators.</p>
<p>If you wish to help me realize the goals set by the Elohim, write to me, Rael at:</p>
<p><strong>International Raelian Movement</strong>
<strong>Case Postale 225, CH 1211</strong>
<strong>Geneva 8</strong>
<strong>Switzerland</strong></p>
<p>or by email to: <strong>headquarters@rael.org</strong></p>
<p>Also, do not forget that regular local meetings of people who believe in this final message are held on the first Sunday of April, on the 6th of August, the 7th of October and the 13th of December each year. The venues for these meetings will be set out in the liaison bulletin of the Raelian Movement of your country, and some addresses to help you make contact are listed at the end of this book.</p>
