<p>It was during June 1975 that I decided to resign as president of MADECH, first of all because it seemed that the movement could now manage very well without me, and secondly because I thought I had made a mistake in structuring the organization in accordance with a 1901 law that likened the movement, which is of such importance to humanity, to a petanque club or a war veterans' association.</p>
<p>I thought it was necessary to create a movement more in harmony with the fantastic message the Elohim had transmitted to me. This required a movement that respected to the letter what our creators had advised — namely geniocracy, humanitarianism, the renunciation of all deistic religious practices, and so on.</p>
<p>Any association based on that 1901 law ran contrary to the meaning of the Elohim's message by definition, at least in the way we had structured it. Since all members of such an association could vote, we were not respecting the principles of geniocracy, according to which only the most intelligent people may take part in making decisions.</p>
<p>So I had to correct this fundamental mistake, not by going so far as to abolish MADECH, but rather by transforming it, pending more effective modification of its structure. This would not run contrary to the regulations of the 1901 law. In this way, MADECH would become an organization that would support the real movement that I was going to create with its most open-minded members — in effect, a congregation of MADECH guides. This new association would bring together those people who wished to open others' minds to infinity and eternity and become guides for humanity by scrupulously applying what was required in the Elohim's message. So, in a society seeking to close people's minds in every way with deistic religions, soporific education, unthinking television programs and petty political battles, I was going to try to initiate people who would go out into the world and attempt to open the minds of others. Thus MADECH would retain its importance by becoming a support organization that would be the first point of contact for those discovering the Elohim's message. It would be made up of practicing members, and the congregation of guides was going to be a movement made up of &quot;monks&quot; guiding those practicing members.</p>
<p>I knew that there were people among the MADECH members who were quite capable of managing the organization, and I received confirmation of this during the elections to the administrative council. My replacement as president, Christian, was a physicist with a promising future, and the rest of the council was made up of people who were all equally representative and competent.</p>
<p>It was also in the month of June that François, one of the most devoted MADECH members and one of the most open-minded,</p>
<p>came to see me in Clermont-Ferrand. I told him about my desire to find a country house in as secluded a place as possible, in order to rest a little and calmly write a book in which I would relate all that had happened to me prior to 13 December 1973, before anyone could invent a lot of nonsense about my past. He told me that he had a farm in an out of the way place in Périgord, and that if I liked the area, I could spend a month or two there, and even stay as long as I wished, since nobody lived there.</p>
<p>We immediately drove off to visit the place, and inspired by the peace and quiet that I found there, I decided to stay for two months.</p>
<p>After two weeks, I was enjoying it so much that I seriously considered settling there more permanently. François came back to join us at the end of July, and we started planning the move for the day after a celebration meeting at Clermont-Ferrand on the 6th of August. I still had not decided for sure because I was afraid I might fail in my mission somehow if I moved away from the place of my marvelous encounter. However, on July 31st, while my wife Marie-Paule, Francois and I were out getting some fresh air, we saw what must have been an enormous craft passing silently and with jerky movements almost over the house.</p>
<p>At times it moved with unimaginable speed, but it also stopped suddenly several times, proceeding in a zigzag pattern like this about 500 meters from where we stood. I was delighted that other people were with me to witness the event, and an indescribable feeling of happiness came over me. François told me that the hairs on his head stood on end from emotion. To me, it was an obvious sign of the Elohim's consent to my moving to that area.</p>
<p>The next morning I noticed that I had a strange mark on the bicep of one arm, close to the fold of my elbow. I did not immediately make the connection to the sighting of the day before, but later many people told me that it could only have been a mark made by the Elohim. It was a red circle about three centimeters in diameter, its circumference was five millimeters thick, and inside it were three smaller circles.</p>
<p>This mark stayed the same for the next two weeks, then the three circles in the middle merged into one, making two concentric circles. Then, after another two weeks, the two circles disappeared, leaving a white spot on my arm, which I still have. I wish to emphasize the fact that I never suffered from that mark, and that I did not feel the least itching during the entire time I had it.</p>
<p>Some open-minded scientists to whom I showed the mark speculated that it could have been made while a sample was being taken with the help of a perfected laser.</p>
<p>The reunion of August 6th finally took place as planned in the crater of Puy-de-Lassolas, near Clermont-Ferrand, and at that meeting a splendid feeling of fraternity and harmony prevailed.</p>
<p>I had decided to hold this gathering of MADECH members on this date without really knowing why, but in fact the Elohim had guided me because on the day of the meeting some members informed me that it was the thirtieth anniversary to the day of the atomic bomb explosion at Hiroshima, and that it was also a Christian holiday, the Transfiguration. Fools will say that it was a coincidence.</p>
<p>After that meeting, some MADECH members helped me to move, and I settled down to live in Périgord.</p>
<h2 id="the-message-part-two"><a class="header" href="#the-message-part-two">The Message: Part Two</a></h2>
<p>On October 7th, at around eleven o'clock at night, I felt a sudden urge to go out and look at the sky. I dressed warmly because it was rather cool and set out walking in the dark. I was going in a certain direction without being conscious of it, and suddenly felt the need to go to a spot that François had shown me during the summer — a deserted place between two brooks and surrounded by forest. It was called the Roc Plat. I reached it around midnight, half wondering what I was doing there, but following my intuition since I had been told that I could be guided telepathically.</p>
<p>The sky was magnificent, and stars were shining everywhere, for there was not a single cloud to be seen. As I stood watching the shooting stars, the whole countryside suddenly lit up, and I saw a huge ball of fire, like a spark, appear behind some bushes. I moved towards the place where the ball of fire had appeared, filled with a tremendous joy, as I was almost certain of what I was going to find.</p>
<p>The same craft that I had seen on six occasions in the month of December 1973 was there in front of me, and the same person I had met two years earlier came towards me with a smile full of kindness.</p>
<p>I noticed one difference right away. He no longer had on the spacesuit that had seemed to make a halo around his face the first time. After all the time I had spent trying to make the world understand that I was indeed telling the truth, I was wonderfully happy to see once more the person who had been responsible for turning my life upside down. I bowed before him, and he spoke.</p>
<p>'Stand up and follow me,' he said. 'We are very satisfied with you and with everything you have done for the past two years. It is now time to pass on to the next stage, since you have proven to us that we can trust you.</p>
<p>These two years were in fact just a trial. You can see that today I have no protection around my face, and that my craft appeared to you all at once and was not equipped with flashing lights. All of that was only intended to reassure you, so that I would appear in a way that corresponds to the image that you generally have of space travelers. But now that you are sufficiently evolved not to take fright, we won't use such approach techniques any more.'</p>
<p>Following him inside the craft, I noticed that its interior looked very similar to what I had found at our first meeting — walls with the same metallic appearance as the outside, no control board or instruments, no portholes, and a floor made of a translucent blue substance on which stood two armchairs. These were made of a transparent material that reminded me a little of inflatable plastic chairs, but without feeling unpleasant.</p>
<p>He invited me to sit down in one of the two chairs, settled into the other, and asked me not to move. He then pronounced a few words in an incomprehensible language, and I seemed to feel the machine rock slightly. Then all of a sudden, I felt a sensation of severe cold, as if my whole body were turning into a block of ice, or rather as if thousands of ice crystals were penetrating all the pores of my skin, right down to the marrow of my bones. It lasted a very short time, a few seconds perhaps, and I felt nothing after that.</p>
<p>Then my companion rose and said: 'You may come, we have arrived.'</p>
<p>I followed him down the small stairway. The craft stood motionless in a metallic-looking circular room about fifteen meters in diameter and ten meters high. A door opened, and my guide told me to go in and undress completely. After that, I would receive further</p>
<p>instructions. I went into a new circular room that did not have the slightest angle and must have been about four meters in diameter. I undressed, and a voice told me to go into the room that was in front of me.</p>
<p>At that moment a door opened, and I went into a room similar to the one where I had left my clothes, but it was long and a little like a corridor. Along the length of that corridor I passed under lights of different colors in turn. The voice then told me that by following the arrows painted on the floor, I would arrive in yet another room where a bath awaited me.</p>
<p>In this next room I did indeed find a sunken bathtub. The water was lukewarm, just right, and discreetly perfumed. The voice advised me to satisfy my personal needs, which I did, and then it asked me to drink the contents of a glass located on a small shelf by the metallic wall. It was a white liquid deliciously savored with almonds, and very cold. Then some soft, pajama-like clothes that felt like silk were offered to me. They were white, very close fitting, and had been laid out ready for me on another shelf. At last a final door opened, and I found my guide again. He was escorted by two people who were of similar appearance to him but with different features, and they were every bit as welcoming.</p>
<p>I rejoined them in a huge hall where I found wonder after wonder.</p>
<p>It was arranged on several levels and must have measured 100 meters in diameter. It was covered by an absolutely transparent dome, so transparent that at first sight it was not clear even that it was a dome. Thousands of stars studded the dark sky, and yet the entire hall was brightly lit with a soft, natural looking light, as if it were midday. The floor was covered with furs and shaggy carpets of astounding, enchanting colors. The most admirable works of art were everywhere, each one more beautiful than the last, and some had animated and changing colors. Elsewhere there were plants — some bright red and others blue, as beautiful as exotic fish but several meters tall.</p>
<p>Background music was playing that sounded like an organ and a musical saw, with occasional choirs and bass voices producing extraordinary vibrations.</p>
<p>This music made the flowers bend and sway in rhythm, and they changed colors with each change of musical style.</p>
<p>Every time someone spoke, the music grew softer so that we could hear each other without difficulty and without having to raise our voices. The air was perfumed with a thousand scents that also changed with the music and our positions in the room. The whole area had been designed with about ten angled corners, which were separated at different levels and each corner had a particular character. A small stream meandered through all this.</p>
<p>My guide's two companions were showing him great respect, and the next thing he said to me was: 'Follow me. We shall make ourselves comfortable, since I have many things to tell you.'</p>
<p>I followed him to a group of armchairs and sofas made of a very soft black fur, where all four of us sat down. There my guide spoke again:</p>
<p>'Today I am going to give you a second message that will complete the one that I dictated to you in December 1973. You don't have anything to take notes with, but don't worry, everything that I say to you will remain engraved in your mind, because here we have a technique that allows you to remember everything you hear.</p>
<p>First of all, we wish to congratulate you for all that you have done over the past two years, but we also wish to warn you that the rest of your mission may be more difficult. But never be discouraged in any case, because you will be rewarded for your efforts, whatever happens now.</p>
<p>To begin with, we must correct a passage in the first message we gave you that you wrongly transcribed concerning an eventual intervention on our part to destroy humanity. It must be made clear that we will not intervene. Humanity is now arriving at a turning point in its history, and its future depends only on itself. If you can control your aggressiveness towards each other and your</p>
<p>environment, then you will reach a golden age of interplanetary civilization, in which universal happiness and fulfillment will be realized. If, on the other hand, your civilization gives way to violence, then it will destroy itself, either directly or indirectly through all this.</p>
<p>No scientific or technical problem is insurmountable for human genius, as long as human genius is in control. But someone with a deficient brain can threaten worldwide peace, just as a person of genius can bring the world happiness.</p>
<p>The sooner you set up geniocracy, the sooner you will remove the possibility of a cataclysm caused by people with minds that are not very evolved. In the event of a cataclysm destroying humanity, only the people who follow you will be saved, and they will have to repopulate the devastated Earth when all the danger has been dispersed, as happened in Noah's time.'</p>
<h2 id="buddhism"><a class="header" href="#buddhism">Buddhism</a></h2>
<p>My guide continued:</p>
<p>'Buddhism explains that at the time of death, the soul of the dead person must be vigilant enough to escape numerous devils, otherwise it will be reincarnated and fall back into the cycle. On the other hand, if it manages to escape those infamous devils, it will be liberated from the cycle and attain a state of bliss through awakening.</p>
<p>In fact, this is a very good description, which applies not to the individual but to humanity as a whole. It must resist those devils, which can make it fall back into the cycle each time it is in a position to choose. Those &quot;devils&quot; are aggressiveness directed against our fellow human beings or against nature, and the &quot;state of bliss through awakening&quot; is a golden age of civilization in which science serves the people, thus producing an earthly paradise, where the blind can see and the deaf can hear by scientific means.</p>
<p>If humanity is not sufficiently wary of these devils, it will fall back into the cycle of reincarnation, where it must start all over again from a primitive state and advance progressively towards a more evolved society in a hostile world, with all the suffering which that entails.</p>
<p>That is why we can find the swastika in our symbol, as in numerous ancient writings, which signifies &quot;the cycle&quot;. It is the choice between paradise, which the peaceful use of science makes possible, and the hell of returning to the primitive stage where humanity submits to nature instead of dominating and benefiting from it.</p>
<p>In a way, this is natural selection at the cosmic level for species that are capable of leaving their planet. Only those who perfectly control their aggressiveness can reach this stage. The others self-destruct as soon as their scientific and technological levels permit them to invent weapons powerful enough to do so. That is why we never fear those who come from elsewhere to contact us. Thousands of contacts have confirmed this absolute rule in the universe — people capable of escaping their planetary system are always peaceful.</p>
<p>When a species is capable of leaving its own solar system, it means that it has overcome the &quot;progress-destruction cycle&quot; that can occur when mastery of its own aggressive tendencies is lacking. At the same time that you discover powerful energy sources allowing you to travel beyond your own solar system, you also become capable of creating offensive weapons of irreversible destructive power.</p>
<p>Your region of the terrestrial globe, France, is already on the right track in its attempt to unite Europe, and it should be the first country without an army. France would thus set an example for the entire world. Its military professionals would then lay the foundation for a peacekeeping European army, eventually transforming it into a world peace corps. Instead of being the guardians of war, the military would then be the guardians of peace, a title deserving infinitely more respect.</p>
<p>It is necessary for an important country to show the way for others to follow, and France's neighboring countries will not invade her just because she has abolished compulsory military service and is using her professional army in the service of the Europe that she is trying to construct.</p>
<p>On the contrary, this would very quickly cause other countries to follow suit and pursue the same path taken by your country. Once Europe is united militarily, creating a single European currency can unite its economy.</p>
<p>Then the same process could be applied throughout the world, adding as we have already told you in the first message, a single world language that would become compulsory in every school on Earth. If one country must show the way, then France is that country. It is by advocating a &quot;deterrent force&quot; that we accumulate the arms of our own destruction.</p>
<p>With each country wishing to deter some other country, and in practice never quite knowing which one, an unfortunate action could then threaten to transform that &quot;deterrent force&quot; into a force of intervention, which could be fatal to the whole world.</p>
<p>It is through the past that humanity views the future. This is a mistake. We should instead be critical of the past and build the present for the future, rather than build the present on the basis of the past. You must understand that barely thirty years ago, people of countries that are now advanced were still primitive. You are only just emerging. There are millions of people on Earth who are still primitive and incapable of seeing something in the sky as anything other than a &quot;divine&quot; manifestation. Moreover, you know that deistic religions are still very strong in all the economically less-developed countries.</p>
<p>You must not revere people for their age, but for their intelligence, while seeing to it that old people have a pleasant life. Our distant ancestors should not be respected, and furthermore they should be seen as an example of poor, limited, primitive people who were unable to open themselves to the universe, and who were capable of handing down only very few things of value from one generation to the next.'</p>
<h2 id="neither-god-nor-soul"><a class="header" href="#neither-god-nor-soul">Neither God nor Soul</a></h2>
<p>My guide went on to say:</p>
<p>'The more primitive a society is, the more deistic religions will flourish within it. This fact is actually cultivated by visitors from other planets, who have no other way of peacefully visiting worlds that have not yet overcome their aggressiveness.</p>
<p>If you reach the stage where you become evolved visitors on primitive worlds, you will be forced to use such a system, which is in fact very amusing and involves passing yourselves off as gods in their eyes. In fact, this is extremely easy since, for primitive people, if you come from the sky, you can only be divine. Of course, you must lay it on a bit thick to be respected and pleasantly received, which does no harm. We continue to make appearances on Earth to see if this still works and to see the reactions of public authorities, governments, and the press. We often amuse ourselves quite a lot...</p>
<p>As we have already explained to you in the first part of this message, there is no God, and obviously, no soul. After death there is nothing, unless science is used to create something. As you know, it is possible to recreate a dead organism from one of the organism's cells, which contains its physical and intellectual blueprint. We have noted that an organism loses a few grams at the moment of its death — in fact this is merely the energy that all living things have available to them, which is eliminated at that moment. As you know, energy, like matter, has weight.</p>
<p>You also know that we have discovered that there is organized, intelligent life on the level of the infinitely small, quite certainly as evolved as we are and comparable to what we are ourselves. We have been able to prove this.</p>
<p>From there, we have discovered that the stars and planets are the atoms of a gigantic being, which itself certainly contemplates other stars with curiosity. It is also highly likely that the people living on the infinitely small levels of the infinitely large person and his fellow creatures have known periods when they believed in an immaterial &quot;God&quot;.</p>
<p>You must fully understand that everything is in everything. At this moment in an atom of your arm, millions of worlds are being born and others are dying, believing or not believing in a &quot;God&quot; and a soul, and when a millennium has gone by for you, the gigantic being of whom the sun is an atom has only had the time to take one step.</p>
<p>Time is, in fact, inversely proportional to the mass, or rather to the level of the form of life. But everything in the universe is alive and in harmony with the infinitely large and the infinitely small.</p>
<p>The Earth is alive like all the planets, and for the small growth that is humanity, it is difficult to notice this because of the time lag due to the enormous difference in mass, which prevents you from perceiving its palpitations. Nor could one of our red blood cells, or better still, one of the atoms that make up our body imagine that it forms, with its peers, a living being.</p>
<p>Finally, whatever happens to each individual, the universal balance remains constant. But if we want to be happy at our level, we must live in harmony with the infinitely large, the infinitely small, and with our fellow human beings.</p>
<p>No argument aiming to support the existence of any type of god or soul can be sustained when we glimpse, however briefly, at the infinite nature of the universe. No heaven could exist in any particular place because, since the universe is infinite, it cannot have a center. Besides, as I have already explained, there cannot be any communication between an infinitely large entity and a universe of infinitely small entities, because the difference in mass is too great, thus creating a difference in the flow of equivalent time.</p>
<p>Finally, if one can imagine an immortal soul escaping from the body after death —an image that is very poetic but rather naive since it comes from the minds of primitives— one cannot imagine where it would go, given that the universe is infinite.</p>
<p>The quantity of energy that flies off at the time of death disperses in a random way, losing all identity as it blends with all the energies suspended in the surrounding air. That identity is obviously engraved only in organized matter, such as the cells of a living being that has just died. This matter is organized according to the blueprint, which the genes of the male and the female determined at conception while creating the first cell.</p>
<p>With regard to the origin of life on Earth, some people might say:</p>
<p>&quot;Your explanation doesn't change a thing, since you cannot say what there was at the very beginning.&quot;</p>
<p>This is a foolish comment, which proves that the person who makes it has no awareness of infinity, which exists in time as well as in space. There is neither a beginning nor an end to matter, since &quot;nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed,&quot; as you have already heard it said. Only the form of matter can change according to the wishes of those who have reached a scientific level, which allows them to accomplish this.</p>
<p>It is the same for the infinite levels of life. That is what the second part of our emblem represents. The Star of David, which is composed of two intertwined triangles, means &quot;as above, so below.&quot; With the swastika, which signifies that everything is cyclic, in the middle of a six-pointed star, you have our emblem, which contains all the wisdom in the world. You can also find the two symbols together in ancient writings like the <em>Bardo Thodol</em> or Tibetan <em>Book of the Dead</em>, and in many other writings as well.</p>
<p>It is evidently very difficult for a finite human brain to be conscious of infinity, which explains the need to limit the universe in time and space by belief in one or several gods that are made responsible for everything.</p>
<p>Indeed, those who cannot reach a sufficient level of human understanding towards the universe have trouble accepting the notion of infinity, which makes humanity nothing exceptional, but merely people situated at a particular time and place in the infinite universe.</p>
<p>People obviously prefer things to be well defined, well framed, limited in a way, in the image of their own minds. Those who ask themselves if it is possible that there is life on other planets are the best example of those limited minds, and we liked very much the comparison you made during one of your lectures, likening such people to frogs at the bottom of their own pond wondering whether there was life in other ponds.'</p>
<h2 id="paradise-on-earth"><a class="header" href="#paradise-on-earth">Paradise on Earth</a></h2>
<p>'You could very soon live in a genuine terrestrial paradise if only the technology that you have at your disposal today were made to serve human well-being, instead of serving violence, armies, or the personal profit of a few.</p>
<p>Science and technology can totally liberate humanity, not only from the problem of hunger in the world, but also from the obligation to work to live, since machines can quite easily look after the daily chores by themselves, thanks to automation.</p>
<p>Already, in some of your most modern factories, where it used to take several hundred people to build one car, now only a single individual is needed to oversee a computer that commands and carries out all the car building operations. In the future, even that one person will be unnecessary. Workers' unions are not happy about this because factories are in less and less need of personnel and are letting more and more workers go. This is not normal — these fantastic machines which do the work of 500 people should enable those 500 to really live, rather than enrich only one person, their boss.</p>
<p>No individual should be in the service of another, nor work for anyone for a salary. Machines can easily do all the chores and take care of all the work, enabling people to dedicate themselves to the one thing for which they were created — to think, create and blossom.</p>
<p>That is what happens on our planet. Your children must no longer be raised according to the three primitive precepts of work, family, and country. On the contrary, they should be brought up following the principles of fulfillment, freedom, and universal fraternity.</p>
<p>&quot;Work&quot; is not sacred when it is motivated only by the need to earn just enough to live a laborious life of hardship. It is even terribly degrading to sell oneself, and one's life, in order to eat, by doing jobs that simple machines could do.</p>
<p>The &quot;family&quot; has never been anything but a way for ancient as well as modern supporters of slavery to force people to work harder for an
illusory family ideal.</p>
<p>Finally, &quot;patriotism&quot; is still only a supplementary means of creating competition between people and urging them to perform their sacrosanct work with greater ardor each day.</p>
<p>What is more, those three concepts —work, family, and country— have always been supported by primitive religions. But now, you are no longer primitive people. Shake off all those dusty old principles and make the most of your life on Earth, which science can transform into paradise.</p>
<p>Do not be taken in by those who speak to you of potential enemies and allow armament factories to compel underpaid workers to produce destructive weapons that bring profits to big industrialists.</p>
<p>Do not be taken in by those who speak to you in horror of the falling birthrate, because young people understand that they need not have so many children, and that it is better to have fewer so they can be happier, as they won't be too numerous on Earth.</p>
<p>Do not be taken in by those who constantly brandish remarks under your nose, saying things like &quot;neighboring peoples are multiplying and could become a threat.&quot; They are the same people who support the stockpiling of nuclear weapons under the pretext of &quot;deterrence&quot;.</p>
<p>Finally, do not let yourself be taken in by those who tell you that military service enables you to learn how to use a gun and that &quot;it can always be useful&quot;, while they continue to pile up nuclear missiles.</p>
<p>They want to teach you violence, to teach you not to be afraid of killing a person like yourself, using the excuse that he is wearing a different uniform, and training you until it becomes a mechanical reflex after repeated practice against training targets.</p>
<p>Do not be taken in by those who tell you that you must fight for your country. No country deserves it. Do not be influenced by those who say to you: &quot;What if enemies invade our country, shouldn't we defend ourselves?&quot; Answer that non-violence is always more efficient than
violence.</p>
<p>It is not proven that those who died for France were right, no matter how hostile their aggressors were. Look at the triumph of Gandhi in India.</p>
<p>Such people will tell you that you must fight for your liberty, but they forget that the Gauls lost their war against the Romans, and that the French are no worse off for being descendants of the conquered, having benefited from the civilization of the conquerors. Live rather in fulfillment, freedom and love, instead of listening to all those narrow-minded, aggressive people.</p>
<p>The most important aid you have to help you reach a long and lasting universal peace is television, the source of a genuine planetary awareness that makes it possible to see what goes on every day all over the globe and realize that the &quot;barbarians&quot; who live on the other side of the border have all the same joys, the same sorrows and the same problems as yourselves. It also records the progress of science, the latest artistic creations, and so on.</p>
<p>Of course, it is important to ensure that this wonderful tool of diffusion and communication does not fall into the hands of people who would use it to condition masses of people by providing biased information.</p>
<p>But you really can consider television to be the nervous system of humanity, which enables each individual to be aware of the existence of others and to see how they live. It also prevents the spread of distorted ideas about others that create a fear of strangers. Long ago there was fear of the neighboring tribe, then fear of the neighboring village, of the neighboring province, and of the neighboring state.</p>
<p>There is currently a fear of the neighboring race, and if this no longer existed, there would be fear of potential aggressors coming from another planet.</p>
<p>It is necessary to reverse this attitude and be open to everything that comes from the outside, because all fear of strangers is proof of a primitive level of civilization. In this sense, television is irreplaceable and is possibly the most important development of any civilization because, in the same way as radio, it enables all those isolated cells of humanity, which people are, to be informed at all times of what the others are doing. As already indicated, it works exactly as the nervous system does in the body of a living being.'</p>
<h2 id="the-other-world"><a class="header" href="#the-other-world">The Other World</a></h2>
<p>'You are probably wondering where you are,' my guide said. 'In fact, you are now on a base located relatively close to the Earth. In the first message, you noted that we traveled seven times faster than the speed of light. That was true 25,000 years ago when we landed on Earth.</p>
<p>Since then, we have made much progress, and we now travel through space much faster. It only takes us a few moments to make the journey that used to take us almost two months in those times, and we continue to progress. If you will now follow me, we will take a little trip together.'</p>
<p>I rose and followed my three guides. We went through an airlock, and in a vast room I noticed a craft similar to the one that had brought me from Earth, but it was far larger. The exterior must have been about twelve meters in diameter, and inside it had four seats facing each other instead of just two. We sat down as before, and again I felt the same sensation of intense cold, but it lasted much  longer this time — about ten minutes. Then the craft rocked slightly, and we stepped out through the trap door exit.</p>
<p>Before me a paradisiacal landscape unfolded, and in fact I cannot find any words to describe my enchantment at seeing huge flowers, each more beautiful than the last, and animals of unimaginable appearance were walking among them. There were birds with multicolored plumage, and pink and blue squirrels with the heads of bear cubs climbing in the branches of trees that bore both enormous fruits and gigantic flowers.</p>
<p>About thirty meters from the spacecraft, a small group of Elohim was waiting for us, and behind the trees I was able to make out a group of buildings that resembled brightly colored shells harmonizing perfectly with the vegetation. The temperature was very mild, and the air was perfumed with countless scents of exotic flowers. We walked towards the top of a hill, and a marvelous panorama began to appear. Innumerable small streams wound through the lush vegetation, and far off an azure sea sparkled in the sun.</p>
<p>Reaching a clearing, I discovered with great astonishment a group of people similar to me, by which I mean people resembling those who live on Earth, not Elohim. Most of them were naked or wore robes made of multicolored silks. They bowed respectfully before my three guides, and then we all sat down.</p>
<p>Our armchairs seemed to have been carved in the rock and were covered with thick furs that always remained fresh and comfortable despite the warmth. Some people came out of a small cave located right next to us and approached us carrying trays piled high with fruits, grilled meats accompanied by the most incredible sauces, and drinks of unforgettable flavors.</p>
<p>Behind each guest two of the men who carried the trays were kneeling ready to satisfy the slightest wish of those who were eating. The latter would ask them for whatever they desired without even looking at them.</p>
<p>During the meal some marvelous music had started up, from where I could not tell, and young naked women with figures as sculptural as those of the waiters started to dance with incomparable grace on the surrounding lawn.</p>
<p>There must have been some forty guests who were similar to people from Earth in addition to my three guides. There were white, yellow and black men and women who all spoke a language I could not understand that resembled Hebrew.</p>
<p>I was sitting to the right of the Eloha whom I had met two years earlier, and to the left of the six other Elohim. Facing me sat a young bearded man, very handsome and very slim. He wore a mysterious smile and an expression filled with fraternal feeling. To his right was a man with a noble face sporting a black beard that was very thick and very long. To his left was a more corpulent man with an Asian face. He had a shaven head.</p>
<h2 id="meeting-the-ancient-prophets"><a class="header" href="#meeting-the-ancient-prophets">Meeting the Ancient Prophets</a></h2>
<p>Towards the end of the meal, my guide started to speak to me:</p>
<p>'In my first message I told you of a residence located on our planet where people from Earth can continue to live thanks to the scientific secret of eternity that is based on a single cell.</p>
<p>Among those people are Jesus, Moses, Elijah and so on. This residence is, in fact, very large, since it is an entire planet where the members of the Council of the Eternals live as well. My name is Yahweh, and I am the president of that Council of the Eternals.</p>
<p>There are currently 8,400 people from Earth living on the planet where we are at this moment. They are people who during their lives reached a sufficient level of open-mindedness towards the infinite, or who enabled humanity on Earth to progress from its primitive level through their discoveries, their writings, their ways of organizing society and their exemplary acts of fraternity, love or selflessness.</p>
<p>Alongside them live the 700 Elohim members of the Council of the Eternals. Whatever the outcome of your mission may be, you have your place reserved here among us in this veritable little paradise where everything is easy, thanks to science, and where we live happily and eternally. I can truly say eternally, for, as on Earth, we created all life here, and we are starting to understand perfectly the life of the infinitely large, that is to say, of the planets, and we can detect signs of old age in solar systems, which will enable us to leave this planet in time to create another paradise elsewhere, as soon as we grow anxious about its survival.</p>
<p>The eternals who live here, both people from Earth and Elohim, can fulfill themselves as they wish, without having to do anything but that which pleases them — scientific research, meditation, music, painting, and so on. Or they can do nothing at all if they feel like it.</p>
<p>The servants you saw carrying the dishes a little while ago, as well as the dancers, are just biological robots. They are created according to the same principle we used to create the people of Earth in a totally scientific way, but they have been limited and are absolutely submissive to us.</p>
<p>They are also incapable of acting without orders from us, and they are very specialized. They have no aspirations of their own, and no pleasure, except those that are necessary for their specialization. They grow old and die like us, but the machine that makes them can make far more than we need. They are incapable of feelings or suffering, and cannot reproduce themselves.</p>
<p>Their life span is similar to ours — that is to say about 700 years with the help of a small surgical intervention. When one of them must be destroyed due to old age, the machine that created them produces one or several others, depending on our needs. They come out of the machine ready to function and with their normal height, for they have neither growth nor childhood.</p>
<p>They only know how to do one thing: obey people from Earth and Elohim, and they are incapable of the slightest violence.</p>
<p>They can all be recognized by the small blue stone that both males and females wear between their eyes. They take care of the dirty jobs and do all the work that is uninteresting. They are produced, taken care of and destroyed underground where, in fact, all the maintenance work is done by such robots and by enormous computers that regulate all the problems of nourishment, supply of rawmaterials, energy and other things. We each have on average ten robots at our service, and as there are slightly more than 9,000 of us —Earth people and Elohim— there is a permanent total of 90,000 male and female robots.</p>
<p>Like the Elohim members of the Council of the Eternals, the eternals from Earth are not allowed to have children. They agree to have a small operation, which makes them sterile, but that sterility can easily be reversed. The purpose of this measure is to prevent undeserving beings from joining us in this marvelous world.</p>
<p>However, male and female eternals can unite freely just as they wish, and all jealousy is eliminated.</p>
<p>In addition, men who wish to have one or more companions outside the relationships of equality that exist between eternal men and women, or who do not want to live with a woman on an equal basis, may have one or more totally submissive biological robot women with the exact appearance that is desired. The same goes for women, who can have one or several totally submissive biological robot men.</p>
<p>The machine that generates the robots gives the entity that it creates the exact physical appearance and specialization desired.</p>
<p>There are several types of ideal women and men in terms of shape and physiognomy, but the height, measurements, shape of the face, and so on, can be modified as one wishes. One can even submit the picture of someone particularly admired or loved on Earth, for example, and the machine will produce an exact replica. Thus the relationships between eternals of both sexes are much more fraternal and respectful, and the unions between them are marvelously pure and high.</p>
<p>Because of the extraordinary level of open-mindedness of those admitted here, there is never any problem between them. The majority spends almost all of their time meditating, doing scientific research, making inventions and artistic compositions, and creating all sorts of things. We can live in different cities with multiple architectural styles in greatly varied sites that we can modify at will.</p>
<p>People fulfill themselves as they wish, only doing what they like to do. Some find pleasure in doing scientific experiments, others in playing music, others in creating ever more amazing animals and others in meditating or doing nothing other than making love while enjoying the numerous pleasures of this heavenly environment, drinking from the innumerable fountains and eating the juicy fruits that grow all over the place at all times. Here there is no winter; we all live in a region comparable to your equator, but as we can scientifically control the climate, it is always fine weather and not too hot. We make the rain fall during the night when and where we wish.</p>
<p>All this, and many other things, which you could not understand all at once, makes this world a true paradise. Here, everyone is free and can be so in total safety, for all deserve that liberty.</p>
<p>All things that bring pleasure are positive, as long as that pleasure is not harmful to anyone in any way. This is why all sensual pleasures are positive, for sensuality is always an opening up to the outside world, and all such opening is good. On Earth you are only just emerging from all those primitive taboos that tried to make anything to do with sex or nudity appear evil, whereas nothing could possibly be purer.</p>
<p>Nothing is more disappointing for your creators than to hear people say that nudity is something bad: nudity, the image of what we have made. As you can see, almost everyone is naked here; and those dressed in clothes wear them either because they are works of art given to them by other eternals who made them with their own hands, or for elegance and decoration.</p>
<p>When people from Earth are admitted to this world of the eternals, they start out by receiving some chemical education so that nothing surprises them, and they have a good understanding of where they are and why.'</p>
<p>My guide, Yahweh, paused for a moment, and then said: 'You are now sitting directly opposite the man who, 2,000 years ago, was given the responsibility of creating a movement to spread more widely the message we had left originally to the people of Israel — a message which would enable you to be understood now. I am referring to Jesus, whom we were able to recreate from a cell that we had preserved before his crucifixion.'</p>
<p>The handsome, bearded young man seated opposite offered me a smile full of fraternity.</p>
<p>'To his right is Moses, on his left Elijah, and to the left of Jesus sits the one remembered on Earth by the name of Buddha. A little further on you can see Mohammed, in whose writings I am called Allah, because out of respect they did not dare call me by name. The forty men and women present at this meal are all representatives of the religions created after our contacts on Earth.'</p>
<p>All those present looked at me with expressions that were very friendly and amused, probably because they were remembering their own surprise upon arriving in this world.</p>
<p>My guide continued: 'Now I will show you some of our installations.'</p>
<p>He stood up, and I followed him. He invited me to put on a very wide belt bearing a huge buckle. He and his two friends had buckled on the same kind of adornment. Immediately I felt myself being lifted up from the ground and carried at about twenty meters above the grass, almost level with the tops of the trees, at a very great speed, maybe a hundred kilometers per hour, maybe more, towards a precise location. My three companions were with me, Yahweh in front and his two friends behind.</p>
<p>One curious thing, among others, was that I did not feel any wind at all whipping against my face.</p>
<p>We landed in a small clearing, quite close to the entrance of a small cave. We were in fact still being carried by our belts, but only at a height of one meter above the ground, and moving more slowly. We passed through galleries with metallic walls and arrived in a vast hall, in the center of which was an enormous machine surrounded by about ten robots recognizable by the ornaments on their foreheads. There, we landed on the ground again and took off our belts.</p>
<p>Yahweh then spoke: 'Here is the machine that makes biological robots. We are going to create one of them for you.'</p>
<p>He made a sign to one of the robots located near the machine, and the robot touched certain parts of it. Then he made a sign for me to move close to a window measuring about two meters by one meter. </p>
<p>In a bluish liquid I then saw the form of a human skeleton vaguely taking shape. Its form grew clearer and clearer, finally becoming a real skeleton. Then some nerves took shape and formed over the bones, then some muscles and finally some skin and hair. A splendid athlete was now lying there in a position where moments earlier there had been nothing.</p>
<p>Yahweh spoke again: 'Remember in the Old Testament, this description in <em>Ezekiel</em>, Chapter 37:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Son of man, can these bones live?...there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone. And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above...and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The description that you will give of this will certainly be similar to Ezekiel's — apart from the noise, which we have been able to eliminate.'</p>
<p>Indeed, what I had seen corresponded perfectly to Ezekiel's description. Following this, the prostrate figure had slid to the left and disappeared completely from my sight. Then a trap door opened, and I saw the creature whose rapid creation I had witnessed, lying on a very white fabric.</p>
<p>He was still immobile, but suddenly he opened his eyes, got up, came down the few steps that separated him from our level, and after exchanging a few words with another robot, came up to me. He gave me his hand, which I shook, and I felt his skin soft and warm.</p>
<p>'Do you have a picture of a loved one with you?' Yahweh asked.</p>
<p>'Yes,' I answered, 'I have a picture of my mother in my wallet, which I left in my clothes.'</p>
<p>He showed it to me, asking if it was the right one. When I agreed that it was, he gave it to one of the robots, who inserted it in the machine and touched parts of it. Through the window I witnessed yet another creation of a living being. Then, as the skin started to cover the flesh, I realized what was happening: they were making an exact replica of my mother from the picture I had provided. Indeed, a few moments later, I was able to kiss my mother, or rather the image of my mother as she had been ten years before, for the picture I had provided had been taken about ten years previously.</p>
<p>Yahweh then said to me: 'Now allow us to make a very small puncture in your forehead.'</p>
<p>One of the robots came towards me, and with the help of a small device similar to a syringe, pricked my forehead so lightly that I hardly felt it.</p>
<p>Then he inserted the syringe in the enormous machine and touched other parts of it. Again an entity was formed before my eyes.</p>
<p>As the skin covered the flesh, I saw another 'me' take shape, little by little. Indeed, the being that emerged from the machine was an exact replica of myself.</p>
<p>'As you can see,' Yahweh told me, 'this other you is not wearing the small stone on his forehead, which is characteristic of the robots and that the replica of your mother also had.</p>
<p>From a photo we can only make a replica of the physical body, with no psychological personality or almost none, whereas from a sample cell like the one we took from between your eyes, we can create a total replication of the individual whose cell we took, complete with the memory, personality and character. We could now send the other you back to Earth, and people would not notice a thing. But we are going to destroy this replica immediately, for it is of no use to us.</p>
<p>At this moment there are two of you who are listening to me, and the personalities of these two beings are beginning to be different, because you know that you are going to live, and he knows that he is going to be destroyed. But that does not bother him, since he knows he is nothing but yourself. This is more proof, if proof is needed, of the non-existence of the soul - or a purely spiritual entity unique to each body- in which certain primitive people believe.'</p>
<p>After that we left the room that housed that enormous machine, and through a corridor we entered another room containing other equipment.</p>
<p>We approached another machine.</p>
<p>'In this machine are kept the cells of malevolent people who will be recreated to be judged when the time comes. They are cells from those on Earth who preached violence, wickedness, aggressiveness and obscurantism. Despite having in their possession all the elements to understand where they came from, these people did not have the sense to recognize the truth. They will be recreated to undergo the punishment they deserve, after being judged by those whom they made to suffer or by their ancestors or descendants.</p>
<p>You now fully deserve a rest. This robot will be your guide and will provide you with anything you desire until tomorrow morning. We will then have a few more words to say to you, and afterwards we will accompany you back to Earth. Between now and then you will have a foretaste of what awaits you when your mission is completed on your planet.'</p>
<p>The next moment a robot approached and saluted me respectfully.</p>
<p>He was tall, athletic looking, dark, beardless and very handsome.</p>
<h2 id="a-foretaste-of-paradise"><a class="header" href="#a-foretaste-of-paradise">A Foretaste of Paradise</a></h2>
<p>The robot asked me if I wanted to see my room, and after I agreed, he handed me one of the belts used for travelling. I found myself being transported above the ground again, and when I landed once more, I found myself in front of a house that looked more like a scallop shell than a residence. The interior was entirely carpeted with shaggy furs, and there was a huge bed, at least as big as four Earth beds, looking as if it had been sunk into the ground. It was recognizable only by the different colored furs covering it. In one corner of the huge room, there was a massive sunken bathtub as big as a swimming pool, surrounded by vegetation of marvelous shapes and colors.</p>
<p>'Would you like some female companions?' asked the robot.</p>
<p>'Come, you can make your own choice.'</p>
<p>I put my belt on again and found myself transported back in front of the machine used for making robots. A luminous cube appeared in front of me.</p>
<p>I was shown to an armchair facing the cube and given a helmet.</p>
<p>When I had settled down, a magnificent young brunette with</p>
<p>marvelously harmonious proportions appeared three-dimensionally within the luminous cube. She moved in such a way as to show herself off, and had she not been in a cube floating one meter above the ground, I would have thought she was real.</p>
<p>My robot asked me whether she pleased me and if I wished to have her shape altered or her face modified. I told him that I considered her perfect.</p>
<p>He replied that aesthetically speaking, she was the ideal woman, or rather, one of the three types of ideal women, as defined by the computer according to the taste of the majority of residents on the planet. But I could ask for any modification that I desired.</p>
<p>At my refusal to change anything whatsoever about that magnificent creature, a second woman, this time blonde and alluring, appeared in the luminous cube. She was different but just as perfect as the first one. With her I could not find anything to alter either.</p>
<p>Finally, a third young female, this one a redhead more sensual than the first two, appeared in the strange cube. The robot asked me if I cared to see other models, or if these three ideal types of my race would be enough for me. I answered quite naturally that I thought these three people were extraordinary.</p>
<p>At that moment, a magnificent black woman appeared in the cube, then a very fine slender Chinese female, and then finally another voluptuous young Asian woman.</p>
<p>The robot asked me which person I desired to have as a companion. Since I answered that they all pleased me, he went towards the robot making machine and spoke for a moment with one of his peers. Then the machine was set in motion, and I understood what was about to happen.</p>
<p>A few minutes later I was back at my residence with my six companions. There I had the most unforgettable bath that I have ever had, in the company of those charming robots, totally submissive to all my desires.</p>
<p>Afterwards my robot guide asked if I wished to make some music.</p>
<p>When I said 'yes', he took out a helmet similar to the one I had put on before the projection of the female robot models.</p>
<p>'Now,' he said, 'imagine some music that you would like to hear.'</p>
<p>Immediately a sound was heard, corresponding exactly to music that I had been thinking about, and as I constructed a melody in my head, that same melody became a reality with sounds of an amplitude and a sensitivity that were more extraordinary than any I had ever heard. The dream of every composer had become a reality — the ability to compose music directly without having to go through the laborious process of writing and orchestrating.</p>
<p>Then my six adorable companions began dancing to my music in a most voluptuous and bewitching way.</p>
<p>After a while, my robot asked me if I would also care to compose some images. Another helmet was given to me, and I sat in front of a semi-circular screen. I set myself to imagining certain scenes, and these scenes at once became visible on the screen. I was seeing, in fact, an immediate visualization of all the thoughts that came to me. I started thinking about my grandmother, and she appeared on the screen. I thought of a bouquet of flowers, and it appeared; and when I imagined a rose with green spots, it appeared as well. This machine actually made it possible to visualize one's thoughts instantaneously, without having to explain them. What a marvel!</p>
<p>'With training one can create a story and have it played out,' my robot told me. 'Many performances of this kind, performances of direct creation, are held here.'</p>
<p>Finally, after a while, I went to bed and spent the most extravagant night of my life with my marvelous female companions.</p>
<p>The next day, I got up, took another perfumed bath, and then a robot served us a delicious breakfast. Then he asked me to follow him, for Yahweh was expecting me. I put on the transportation belt again, and soon found myself in front of a strange machine, where the president of the Council of the Eternals was waiting for me.</p>
<p>It was not as large as the one that created robots but was still very big. A sizable armchair was embedded in its center.</p>
<p>Yahweh asked me if I had spent a pleasant night, and then explained to me: 'This machine will awaken certain faculties that lie dormant within you. Your brain will then be able to exploit its full potential. Sit down here.'</p>
<p>I sat down in the chair that he indicated, and a sort of shell covered my skull. I thought I was losing consciousness for a moment, and then it felt as if my head were about to explode.</p>
<p>I saw multicolored flashes pass before my eyes. Finally, everything stopped, and a robot helped me out of the armchair. I felt terribly different.</p>
<p>I had the impression that everything was simple and easy.</p>
<p>Yahweh spoke again: 'From now on, we will see through your eyes, hear through your ears, and speak through your mouth. We will even be able to heal through your hands, as we already do at Lourdes and in many other places in the world, for some sick people who deserve our help because of their will to radiate the message we have given you, and because of their efforts to acquire a cosmic mind by opening themselves to infinity.</p>
<p>We observe everyone. Huge computers ensure a constant surveillance of all people living on Earth. A mark is attributed to everyone depending on whether their actions during their life led towards love and truth or towards hate and obscurantism.</p>
<p>When the time comes to evaluate, those who went in the right direction will have the right to eternity on this heavenly planet, those who achieved nothing positive yet were not evil will not be recreated, and for those whose actions were particularly negative, a cell from their body will have been preserved, which will allow us to recreate them when the time comes, so that they can be judged and suffer the punishment they deserve.</p>
<p>You who are reading this message, understand clearly that you can have access to this marvelous world, this paradise. You will be welcomed, you who follow our messenger, Claude Rael, our ambassador on the path to universal love and cosmic harmony, you who will help him realize what we will ask of him — for we see through his eyes, hear through his ears, and speak through his mouth.</p>
<p>Your idea of creating a congregation of guides for humanity is very good. But be strict with regard to their selection, so that our message will never be deformed or betrayed.</p>
<p>Meditation is indispensable for opening one's mind, but asceticism is useless. You must enjoy life with all the strength of your senses, for the awakening of the senses goes together with the awakening of the mind.</p>
<p>Continue to play sports if you wish and if you have the time, for all sports and games are good whether they develop musculature, or better still, self-control as do motor racing and motorbike racing. </p>
<p>A person who feels alone can always try to communicate</p>
<p>telepathically with us, while trying to be in harmony with the infinite; he or she will feel an immense sense of well being. What you have advised concerning a gathering of people who believe in us in each region on Sunday mornings at about eleven o'clock is very good.</p>
<p>Few members are presently doing this.</p>
<p>Mediums are useful, so seek them out. But balance them because their gifts as mediums —which are only gifts of telepathy— unbalance them, and they begin to believe in magic, the supernatural, and other incredibly stupid things, including an ethereal body, which is a new way of trying to believe in the soul which does not exist. In fact, what they are actually doing is tuning into people who lived several centuries ago, and whom we have recreated on this paradisiacal planet.</p>
<p>There is an important revelation, which you may now make. The Jews are our direct descendants on Earth. That is why a specific destiny is reserved for them. They are the descendants of &quot;the sons of Elohim and the daughters of men&quot;, as mentioned in <em>Genesis</em>.</p>
<p>Their original mistake was to have mated with their scientific creations. That is why they have suffered for such a long time.</p>
<p>But for them the time of forgiveness has come, and they will now be able to live peacefully in their recovered country, unless they make another mistake in not recognizing you as our messenger. We wish our embassy on Earth to be built in Israel on a tract of land given to you by the government. If they refuse, you may build it elsewhere, and Israel will undergo a new punishment for not having recognized our messenger.</p>
<p>You must devote yourself entirely to your mission. Do not worry, you will be able to support your family. People who believe in you and therefore in us must help you. You are our messenger, our ambassador, our prophet, and in any case you have your place reserved here among all the other prophets.</p>
<p>You are the one who must gather together people of all religions.</p>
<p>For the movement you have created, the Raelian Movement, must be the religion of religions. I insist that it is indeed a religion, although an atheistic religion, as you have already understood.</p>
<p>Those who help you we shall not forget, and those who cause you trouble we shall not forget either. Do not be afraid and fear no one, for whatever happens you have your place among us. As for those who lose confidence, shake them up a little.</p>
<p>Two thousand years ago, those who believed in our messenger, Jesus, were thrown into a lion's den. Today, what do you risk? The irony of fools? The sneers of those who haven't understood anything and prefer to keep to their primitive beliefs? What is all that compared to a lion's den? What is all that compared with what awaits those who follow you? Truly it is easier than ever to follow one's intuition.</p>
<p>In the Koran, Mohammed, who is among us, has already said on the subject of prophets:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The moment for men to give account is drawing near; and yet in their nonchalance they are turning away (from their creator).</p>
<p>No new warning comes from their creator whom they ignore and laugh at. And their hearts are amused by it.</p>
<p>Those who do evil comfort themselves secretly by saying:</p>
<p>Is not this man only a mortal as we are?</p>
<p>It is a jumble of dreams. He made it all up himself. He is a poet.</p>
<p>But let him bring a miracle like those who were sent in time past.</p>
<p><em>— Koran, Sura 21: 1-5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Already Mohammed had to suffer the sarcasm of some, and Jesus had to suffer it as well. When he was on the cross, some said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If thou be the Son of Elohim, come down from the cross..</p>
<p><em>— Matthew 27: 40.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And yet, as you have seen, Jesus is in marvelous shape and will be for all eternity, as is Mohammed and all those who followed them and believed in them. On the other hand, those who criticized them will be recreated in order to receive their punishment.</p>
<p>The computers that monitor those people who have no knowledge of this message are linked to a system that, at the time of death and from a distance, automatically samples a cell from which they may be recreated if they deserve it.</p>
<p>While waiting to build our embassy, create a seminary for the Guides of the Raelian Movement near the area where you reside. It is there that you who are our prophet, the Guide of Guides, will be able to train those responsible for spreading our message all over the Earth.'</p>
<h2 id="the-new-commandments"><a class="header" href="#the-new-commandments">The New Commandments</a></h2>
<p>Yahweh then said:</p>
<p>'Those who wish to follow you will apply the laws I am now about to give you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You will appear at least once in your lifetime before the Guide of Guides so that he may transmit your cellular plan through  manual contact, or have it transmitted by an initiated Guide, to the computer that will take this into account at your life's assessment hour of judgment.</p>
<p>You will think at least once a day of the Elohim, your Creators.</p>
<p>You will try to radiate the message of the Elohim around you by every possible means.</p>
<p>You will, at least once a year, give a donation to the Guide of Guides that is equal to at least one percent of your annual income, in order to help him devote himself full time to his mission and travel around the world to spread this message.</p>
<p>You will, at least once a year, invite the Guide of your region into your home, and you will gather at your place people who are interested in hearing him explain the message in all its dimensions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the Guide of Guides should disappear, the new Guide of Guides will be the one who has been designated by the former Guide of Guides. The Guide of Guides will be the guardian of the embassy of the Elohim on Earth and will be able to live there with his family and with the people of his choice.</p>
<p>You, Claude Rael, you are our ambassador on Earth, and the people who believe in you must provide you with the means to accomplish your mission.</p>
<p>You are the last of the prophets before the Judgement; you are the prophet of the religion of religions, the demystifier and the shepherd of shepherds. You are the one whose coming was announced in all the religions by the ancient prophets, our representatives.</p>
<p>You are the one who will bring back the shepherds' flock before the water is spilled, the one who will bring back to their creators those they have created. Those who have ears may hear, those who have eyes may see. All those who have their eyes open will see that you are the first prophet who can be understood only by scientifically evolved beings. All that you speak of is incomprehensible to primitive peoples.</p>
<p>This is a sign that will be noticed by those whose eyes are open — the sign of the Revelation, the Apocalypse.'</p>
<h2 id="to-the-people-of-israel"><a class="header" href="#to-the-people-of-israel">To the People of Israel</a></h2>
<p>'The State of Israel must give some territory located near Jerusalem to the Guide of Guides so that he may build there the residence, the embassy of the Elohim. The time has come, people of Israel, to build the New Jerusalem as it was foreseen. Claude Rael is the one who was foretold. Reread your writings and open your eyes.</p>
<p>We wish to have our embassy among our descendants, and the people of Israel are the descendants of the children born of the unions between the sons of Elohim and the daughters of men.</p>
<p>People of Israel, we removed you from the clutches of the Egyptians, and you did not show yourselves worthy of our confidence; we entrusted you with a message destined for all humanity, and you jealously kept it instead of spreading it abroad.</p>
<p>You have suffered for a long time to pay for your errors, but the time of forgiveness has come, and as was foreseen, we have said: &quot;To the North give them up and to the South do not hold them back.&quot; I have gathered your sons and daughters &quot;from the ends of the Earth,&quot; as was written in <em>Isaiah</em>, and you have been able to find your country again. You will be able to live there in peace if you listen to the last of the prophets, the one who was foretold to you, and if you help him to accomplish what we ask of him.</p>
<p>This is your last chance, otherwise another country will welcome the Guide of Guides and build our embassy on its territory, and that country will be close to yours; it will be protected and happiness shall prevail, and the State of Israel will be destroyed once more.</p>
<p>You, child of Israel who has not yet returned to your ancestral lands, wait before returning there to see if the government will agree to our embassy being built there. If they refuse, do not return, and you will be one of those who will be saved from the destruction and whose descendants will one day be able to find the promised land again, when the time comes.</p>
<p>People of Israel, recognize the one foretold to you, give him the territory to build our embassy, and help him build it. Otherwise, as happened 2,000 years ago, it will be constructed elsewhere, and if it is constructed elsewhere, you will be dispersed once again. If, 2,000 years ago, you had recognized that Jesus was indeed our messenger, all the Christians in the world would not be Christians, but Jews. You would not have had problems, and you would have remained our ambassadors. But instead this task was given to other people who took Rome for their base.</p>
<p>Two thousand years ago, you did not recognize our messenger, and it was not Jerusalem but Rome that shone. Now you have a new chance for it to be Jerusalem once more. If you do not seize it, another country will shelter our embassy, and you will no longer have any right to the land we had chosen for you.</p>
<p>There, I have finished. You will be able to annotate all this by yourself once you have returned to Earth. Now enjoy this paradise a while longer, and we will take you back for you to complete your mission before returning to us for good.'</p>
<p>I remained there for several more hours, enjoying the many pleasures of that world, meandering amongst numerous fountains and enjoying the company of the great prophets whom I had met the day before during meditation sessions. Then, after a last meal taken with the same people as the day before, I found myself once again in the large vessel, which set me down at the observation station. From there I retraced my route of the day before, and found myself with my clothes in the small craft, which dropped me off where it had picked me up, at Roc Plat. I looked at my watch — it was midnight.</p>
<p>I returned home, where I immediately set to work to write down all that I had been told. Everything was perfectly clear in my mind, and I was surprised to find that I was writing it all at one stroke, recalling without any hesitation the sentences I had heard. The words remained as if engraved in my mind just as I had been told they would at the beginning.</p>
<p>When I finished the account of what had happened, I began to feel very clearly that something had been released inside me. This had never happened before. I began writing again, all the while observing closely what I was putting down as if I was simultaneously</p>
<p>discovering it as a reader. I was writing, but this time I did not feel like the author of what was appearing on the paper. The Elohim were starting to speak through my mouth, or rather, to write with my hand.</p>
<p>What was being written before my eyes dealt with all areas that a person is confronted with during his or her lifetime, and the right way to react when faced with these problems. It was, in fact, a code of life — a new way of behaving in the face of life's events, of behaving like a man, that is to say, as an evolved being, and therefore trying in every way to open one's mind to infinity and to place oneself in harmony with it.</p>
<p>These great rules dictated by the Elohim, our creators, &quot;Our Fathers who are in Heaven&quot;, as our ancestors used to say without really understanding, are all set forth here in the following pages in their entirety.</p>
